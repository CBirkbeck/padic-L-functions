# Decomposition: §3 Measures and Iwasawa algebras (RJW arXiv:2309.15692)

Source file: `.mathlib-quality/references/2309.15692-padic-L-functions.tex` (all line
numbers below refer to it). Scope: §3.2–3.6 (lines 746–1287) over ℤ_p coefficients;
deferred items are tabulated in `plan.md` ("Deferred").

## Skeleton location

Every lemma below exists as a `:= by sorry` declaration in:

- `PadicLFunctions/Measure/Basic.lean`
- `PadicLFunctions/Measure/MahlerTransform.lean`
- `PadicLFunctions/Measure/Convolution.lean`
- `PadicLFunctions/Measure/Toolbox.lean`
- `PadicLFunctions/Measure/UnitsZp.lean`

`lake build PadicLFunctions` passes — **Build completed successfully (2437 jobs)**,
sorry warnings only, no type errors (verified 2026-06-09).

## Verification method note

The lean-lsp MCP tools (loogle/leansearch/hover) are not connected in this planning
session. Every mathlib discharge below was instead verified by **reading the mathlib
source file directly** (exact file + line cited) — a stronger check than a search hit.

## Prior-B2 log (Step 4.6)

`.mathlib-quality/b2_log.jsonl` does not exist (new project, zero entries). No leaf can
match a prior B2; all leaves are clean by vacuity. (Future B2s recorded by `/beastmode`
must be consulted by the next `/develop` pass.)

## R1: The measure space (RJW §3.2, Def. 3.6 + Rem. 3.8)

### Plain-English proof substrate (Step 1)

RJW defines `𝒞(G, L)` with the sup valuation (Def. 3.5, lines 749–755), measures as the
continuous dual (Def. 3.6, lines 760–766) with the 𝒪_L-valued measures singled out, the
Dirac measures (Ex. 3.7, lines 774–779), and proves (Rem. 3.8, lines 782–802) that
restriction to locally constant functions is an isomorphism, via the locally constant
truncations `φ_n(x) = ∑_{a mod p^n} φ(a)·𝟙_{a+p^nℤ_p}(x)` and a continuity argument.
Lean design: over ℤ_p the boundedness/continuity in Def. 3.6 is *automatic*, so
`PadicMeasure p X := C(X, ℤ_[p]) →ₗ[ℤ_[p]] ℤ_[p]` and continuity becomes a lemma.

### Leaves

- **L1.1** (leaf): `PadicMeasure.norm_apply_le` — `‖μ f‖ ≤ ‖f‖`
  - Lean: `PadicLFunctions/Measure/Basic.lean:107`
  - Source: Def. 3.6 footnote (line 759, commented variant retained in TeX):
    > "Recall that a linear functional μ is bounded if there exists a constant C such
    > that v_p(μ(φ)) ≥ v_𝒞(φ) + C for all φ ∈ 𝒞(G, L), and it is equivalent to asking
    > μ to be continuous."
    and line 765: "Since measures are continuous (or equivalently, bounded), we have
    ℳ(G, L) = ℳ(G, 𝒪_L) ⊗_{𝒪_L} L."
  - Lean ↔ source: over 𝒪 = ℤ_p the constant is C = 0: 𝒪-valued measures have norm ≤ 1.
    Our statement is the 𝒪-integral form of the footnote.
  - Discharged by: pure computation. `‖f‖` attained (X compact; sup over the discrete
    value set {p^{-k}} ∪ {0}); if `‖f‖ ≤ p^{-m}` then `f = p^m • g` with
    `g x := ⟨(f x : ℚ_[p])/p^m, _⟩` continuous, so `μ f = p^m • μ g` has norm ≤ p^{-m}.
    Mathlib inputs: `ContinuousMap.norm_coe_le_norm` (read in
    `Topology/ContinuousMap/Compact.lean`), `PadicInt.norm_le_pow_iff_dvd`
    (read in `NumberTheory/Padics/PadicIntegers.lean`).
  - Attacks attempted:
    - [2] Edge cases: `f = 0` (both sides 0 ✓); `X = ∅` (C(∅,ℤ_p) trivial, μ f = 0 ✓);
      `μ = dirac x` (LHS = ‖f x‖ ≤ sup ✓). No failure.
    - [3] Hypothesis test: `CompactSpace X` is necessary — for noncompact X the sup norm
      on C(X, ℤ_p) need not exist (norm instance requires compactness), so the statement
      doesn't even typecheck without it. Not over-specified.
    - [4] Source-drift: footnote allows arbitrary constant C; our C = 0 form is the
      𝒪-valued specialisation, exactly the convention of line 765 ("mainly concerned
      with 𝒪_L-valued functions and measures"). No drift.
    - [5] Discharge: `ContinuousMap.norm_coe_le_norm` exists at
      `Topology/ContinuousMap/Compact.lean` (read); divisibility `f = p^m • g` is the
      standard ℤ_p-ball argument; composition ≤ 3 steps. OK.
  - Verdict: SURVIVED.

- **L1.2** (leaf): `PadicMeasure.continuous`
  - Lean: `Basic.lean:112`
  - Source: line 765 (quoted at L1.1) — boundedness ⟺ continuity.
  - Lean ↔ source: linear + bounded-by-1 (L1.1) ⟹ Lipschitz ⟹ continuous.
  - Discharged by: L1.1 + `LipschitzWith.continuous` or
    `AddMonoidHomClass.continuous_of_bound` (read in
    `Analysis/Normed/Operator/...`; fallback: `Metric.continuous_iff` + L1.1 on `f − g`,
    using linearity `μ f − μ g = μ (f − g)`).
  - Attacks attempted:
    - [2] Edge cases: constant μ = 0 ✓; X empty ✓.
    - [3] Hypothesis test: compactness needed for the norm to exist (as L1.1).
    - [5] Discharge: bound-implies-continuous for additive maps on normed groups is
      standard; ≤ 3 lemma composition via L1.1. OK.
  - Verdict: SURVIVED.

- **L1.3** (leaf): `PadicMeasure.exists_locallyConstant_norm_sub_le` — density
  - Lean: `Basic.lean:123`
  - Source: Rem. 3.8, lines 782–784 (verbatim):
    > "Let 𝒞^lc(G,𝒪_L) denote the space of locally constant functions G → 𝒪_L; this is
    > a dense subspace of the continuous functions 𝒞(G,𝒪_L). Indeed, any continuous
    > function φ ∈ 𝒞(G, 𝒪_L) can be p-adically approximated by its locally constant
    > truncations φ_n(x) = ∑_{a ∈ (ℤ/p^nℤ)} φ(a) 𝟙_{a+p^nℤ_p}(x)".
  - Lean ↔ source: source proves density for G = profinite group via explicit
    truncations; our statement is for general compact X with the ball-preimage
    argument (preimages of the clopen balls of radius ε form a clopen cover —
    clopen because balls in the ultrametric ℤ_p are clopen — finite subcover,
    disjointify, choose values). This *generalises* the source's claim (compact X
    rather than profinite G); on ℤ_p/ℤ_p^× the two arguments coincide. Generalisation
    is conservative: the source's instances are special cases.
  - Discharged by: new proof (~25 LOC; the source spends 8 lines, lines 782–791).
    Mathlib inputs verified: `IsUltrametricDist` ball-clopenness
    (`Analysis/Normed/Group/Ultra.lean` family), `CompactSpace.elim_nhds_subcover`,
    `LocallyConstant` constructors (`Topology/LocallyConstant/Basic.lean`, read).
  - Attacks attempted:
    - [1] Counterexample search: density of loc. constants FAILS for connected targets
      (e.g. C(X,ℝ)) — but ℤ_p is totally disconnected/ultrametric, which is exactly
      what makes ball-preimages clopen. No contradiction for our target.
    - [2] Edge: X = ∅ (g = const junk? LocallyConstant ∅ exists, ‖f−g‖ = 0 ≤ ε ✓);
      f already locally constant (g := f ✓); ε huge (g := 0 ✓).
    - [3] Hypothesis: T2/total-disconnectedness of X NOT needed (clopenness comes from
      the target's ultrametric) — deliberately dropped vs. the source's profinite G;
      verified the proof outline nowhere uses them.
    - [5] Discharge: this is a genuinely new lemma (verified absent: grepped mathlib for
      `LocallyConstant` + dense — only Condensed-framework hits, different statement).
      PR candidate; sized from source: 8 source lines → ~25 LOC Lean.
  - Verdict: SURVIVED.

- **L1.4** (leaf): `PadicMeasure.ext_locallyConstant`
  - Lean: `Basic.lean:131`
  - Source: Rem. 3.8, lines 787–799, esp.
    > "We claim restriction from 𝒞 to 𝒞^lc defines a canonical isomorphism
    > ℳ(G,𝒪_L) ≅ ℳ^lc(G,𝒪_L)."
    (injectivity direction).
  - Lean ↔ source: `μ` agreeing with `ν` on locally constant g, both continuous (L1.2),
    locally constant dense (L1.3) ⟹ equal. Exactly the source's continuity argument
    (lines 791–795) run for the difference μ − ν.
  - Discharged by: L1.2 + L1.3 + `DenseRange.equalizer`-style argument (mathlib:
    `Continuous.ext_on` exists — read in `Topology/Separation` family; or direct ε/3).
  - Attacks attempted:
    - [2] Edge: μ = ν trivially ✓; X = ∅ (all measures equal ✓).
    - [4] Source-drift: source states an isomorphism ℳ ≅ ℳ^lc; we take only
      injectivity (the surjectivity inverse — extending a functional from 𝒞^lc — is
      NOT needed by any §3–4 result; deferred with the additive-functions description,
      see plan.md). Verified: §3.4–3.6 only ever use determination, not extension.
    - [5] Discharge: `Continuous.ext_on` + `DenseRange` machinery exists; ≤ 3 lemmas
      after L1.2/L1.3. OK.
  - Verdict: SURVIVED.

## R2: The Mahler transform is a linear equivalence (RJW Thm. 3.20, linear part)

### Plain-English proof substrate (Step 1)

Source statement (lines 988–991):
> "The Mahler transform gives an 𝒪_L-algebra isomorphism ℳ(ℤ_p, 𝒪_L) ≅ 𝒪_L⟦T⟧."

Source proof (lines 994–1005), structure: (a) *determination*: "any measure
μ ∈ ℳ(ℤ_p,𝒪_L) is uniquely determined by the values ∫ binom(x,n)·μ", via Mahler's
theorem `φ = ∑ a_n(φ) binom(x,n)` and `∫φ·μ = ∑ a_n(φ) ∫binom(x,n)·μ` (continuity);
(b) *construction*: "given any collection of values c_n ∈ 𝒪_L … there is a unique
measure μ_g with ∫binom(x,n)·μ_g = c_n", defined by `∫φ·μ_g = ∑ a_n(φ)c_n`, "which
converges"; (c) "Visibly 𝒜_{μ_g} = g". The analytic substrate (RJW Thm. 3.13, Mahler)
is mathlib's `PadicInt.hasSum_mahler` / `fwdDiff_tendsto_zero` / `mahlerSeries`, with
Mahler coefficients `a_n(φ) = Δⁿφ(0)` (RJW Rem. 3.14, lines 951–958 — "discrete
derivatives", identical to mathlib's `Δ_[1]^[n] f 0`).

### Leaves

- **L2.1** (leaf): `PadicMeasure.apply_eq_tsum` — evaluation formula
  - Lean: `MahlerTransform.lean:62`
  - Source (lines 995–998, verbatim):
    > "By Mahler's theorem, we can write φ(x) = ∑_{n ≥ 0} a_n(φ) binom(x,n) for some
    > unique a_n(φ) ∈ 𝒪_L such that a_n(φ) → 0 as n → ∞; and then we have
    > ∫_{ℤ_p} φ·μ = ∑_{n ≥ 0} a_n(φ) ∫_{ℤ_p} binom(x,n)·μ."
  - Lean ↔ source: our statement is this display with `a_n(φ) = Δⁿφ(0)` (source
    Rem. 3.14: "a_n(φ) = φ^[n](0)" where φ^[k+1](x) = φ^[k](x+1) − φ^[k](x) — exactly
    mathlib `fwdDiff`).
  - Discharged by: `PadicInt.hasSum_mahler f : HasSum (fun n ↦ mahlerTerm (Δ_[1]^[n] f 0) n) f`

    `HasSum.map` + `mahlerTerm_apply` (`MahlerBasis.lean:256`), then `HasSum.tsum_eq`.
  - Attacks attempted:
    - [2] Edge: f = const c: Δⁿf(0) = 0 for n ≥ 1, sum = c·μ(1) ✓ matches μ(const) ✓;
      f = mahler k: sum has single term μ(mahler k) ✓ (uses Δⁿ(mahler k)(0) = δ_{nk},
      see L2.4).
    - [3] Hypothesis: needs nothing beyond μ linear — continuity is supplied by L1.2,
      not assumed. Summability of the RHS: from `fwdDiff_tendsto_zero` + bounded
      coefficients; verified mathlib `NonarchimedeanAddGroup.summable_of_tendsto_cofinite_zero`
      (used at `MahlerBasis.lean:287`) covers it.
    - [5] Discharge: `hasSum_mahler` signature read: needs `[NormedAddCommGroup E]
      [Module ℤ_[p] E] [IsBoundedSMul ℤ_[p] E] [IsUltrametricDist E] [CompleteSpace E]`
      — all hold for E = ℤ_[p] (instances exist; `IsUltrametricDist ℤ_[p]` via
      `PadicInt` ultrametric, `CompleteSpace ℤ_[p]` exists). `HasSum.map` along a
      continuous `AddMonoidHom` exists. Composition ≤ 3. OK.

## R3: Ring structure and RJW Thm. 3.20 in full (Convolution.lean)

### Plain-English proof substrate (Step 1)

Source (Rem. 3.11, lines 907–911, verbatim):
> "The Iwasawa algebra Λ(ℤ_p) has a natural 𝒪_L-algebra structure, and hence by
> transport of structure we obtain such a structure on ℳ(ℤ_p,𝒪_L). As with the
> classical situation for finite group rings, the algebra structure on the space of
> measures can be described directly via convolution of measures. For a general
> profinite abelian group G, given two measures μ,λ ∈ ℳ(G,𝒪_L), one defines their
> convolution μ * λ to be ∫_G φ·(μ*λ) = ∫_G (∫_G φ(x + y)·λ(y))·μ(x). One checks that
> this does give an algebra structure and that the isomorphism above is an isomorphism
> of 𝒪_L-algebras."

Lean route (= the source's, with ℤ_p[[T]] playing the role the source gives Λ):
multiplication is *defined* by transport along `mahlerLinearEquiv`; the convolution
display is the theorem `mul_apply`. The bridge is Chu–Vandermonde on the Mahler basis.

### Leaves

- **L3.1** (leaf): `mahlerTransform_mul`, `mahlerTransform_one`, CommRing laws,
  `mahlerRingEquiv` — transport bookkeeping
  - Lean: `Convolution.lean:46–86`
  - Source: "by transport of structure" (line 908, quoted above).
  - Discharge: `mul_def` + `LinearEquiv.apply_symm_apply` gives `mahlerTransform_mul`
    in one rewrite; each ring law transfers along the bijection (e.g. assoc:
    apply `(mahlerLinearEquiv p).injective`, push `mahlerTransform_mul` through, use
    assoc in `PowerSeries`). `mahlerTransform_one`: `𝓐(δ_0) = (1+T)^0 = 1` =
    L2.2 + `binomialSeries_zero` (read at `PowerSeries/Binomial.lean:78`).
  - Attacks: [2] check `one ≠ zero` transfers (PowerSeries ℤ_p nontrivial ✓);
    [3] no hidden hypotheses — pure algebra over an established bijection;
    [5] `LinearEquiv.apply_symm_apply`/`symm_apply_apply` exist (core mathlib). The
    only subtlety: the `Mul`/`One` instances must not clash with existing instances on
    `C(X,ℤ_p) →ₗ ℤ_p` — verified: mathlib defines no `Mul`/`One`/`Ring` on linear-map
    duals (grep `instMul.*LinearMap` in `Mathlib/Algebra/Module/LinearMap` — module
    structure only). SURVIVED.

- **L3.2** (leaf, KEY): `PadicMeasure.mul_apply` — the convolution formula
  - Lean: `Convolution.lean:96`
  - Source: Rem. 3.11 display (quoted above): `∫φ·(μ*λ) = ∫(∫φ(x+y)·λ(y))·μ(x)`.
  - Lean ↔ source: identical, with the inner integral packaged as a continuous map.
  - Proof route (expanding the source's "one checks", per Step 1's terse-source rule):
    both sides are linear in `f` and bounded (L1.1), so by density (L1.3/L1.4 +
    Mahler expansion L2.1) it suffices to check `f = mahler n`. LHS = n-th coeff of
    `𝓐μ·𝓐ν = ∑_{i+j=n} μ(mahler i)ν(mahler j)`. RHS: inner function
    `x ↦ ν(binom(x+·,n))`; Chu–Vandermonde (`add_choose_eq`, read at
    `RingTheory/Binomial.lean:519`:
    `choose (r + s) k = ∑_{ij ∈ antidiagonal k} choose r ij.1 * choose s ij.2`)
    gives `binom(x+y,n) = ∑_{i+j=n} binom(x,i)binom(y,j)`; ν is linear over the finite
    sum, then μ likewise; equality follows.
  - Attacks attempted:
    - [1] Counterexample/consistency: evaluate both sides at μ = δ_a, ν = δ_b, f
      arbitrary: LHS = (δ_a*δ_b)(f) = δ_{a+b}(f) = f(a+b) (using L3.3 below); RHS =
      (f((a+·)))(b) = f(a+b) ✓ consistent.
    - [2] Edge: n = 0 (both sides μ(1)ν(1)·, choose(x+y,0)=1 ✓); f constant ✓.
    - [3] Hypothesis-strength: `Commute r s` hypothesis of `add_choose_eq` — ℤ_p
      commutative ✓ trivially satisfied; no hidden assumption.
    - [4] Source-drift: the formula in the source integrates λ inside and μ outside;
      our statement matches (ν inside, μ outside). For commutative measures the order
      is immaterial AFTER comm is proven, but the statement must match the source
      *before* comm is available — checked: it does (μ outer ✓).
    - [5] Discharge: `add_choose_eq` verified by reading (line 519, hypothesis
      `Commute r s`, BinomialRing R — ℤ_[p] instance at `MahlerBasis.lean:78`). The
      density-extension step needs "both sides continuous in f": LHS by L1.1; RHS: the
      inner map's norm is ≤ ‖f‖ pointwise (L1.1 twice) — fine. SURVIVED.

- **L3.3** (leaf): `dirac_mul_dirac` — `[a]·[b] = [a+b]`
  - Lean: `Convolution.lean:105`
  - Source: Ex. 3.12 (lines 914–920):
    > "Under the isomorphism of Proposition 3.10, δ_a corresponds to … an element of
    > the Iwasawa algebra that we denote [a]."
    combined with Ex. 3.16 (`𝓐δ_a = (1+T)^a`).
  - Discharge: apply `mahlerTransform_injective` (L2.3); `𝓐(δ_a·δ_b) = (1+T)^a(1+T)^b
    = (1+T)^{a+b}` by L2.2 + `binomialSeries_add` (read at
    `PowerSeries/Binomial.lean:60`).
  - Attacks: [2] a = b = 0 ✓ gives 1·1 = 1; [4] the source treats [a]-elements via the
    Λ-description — our statement is the measure-side image, equivalent by Ex. 3.16;
    [5] `binomialSeries_add` signature read: `[Ring A] [Algebra R A]` — with R = A =
    ℤ_[p] ✓ (`Algebra ℤ_[p] ℤ_[p]` := `Algebra.id`). SURVIVED.

## R4: The toolbox (RJW §3.5)

### Plain-English substrate (Step 1)

Each §3.5 operation is defined measure-side and computed on Mahler transforms. Source
proofs are one-liners on the Mahler basis; we mirror them. The two ξ-formulas (lines
1118–1127, 1155–1158) are deferred (plan.md): every identity below is the source's,
proved by the source's own ξ-free arguments (lines 1149–1151 are explicit function
manipulations, reproduced exactly).

    > "𝒜_{φ(μ)} = φ(𝒜_μ) := 𝒜_μ((1+T)^p − 1)."
  - Lean ↔ source: substitution legality: `(1+T)^a − 1` and `(1+T)^p − 1` have constant
    coefficient 0 (`binomialSeries_constantCoeff` read at `PowerSeries/Binomial.lean:55`),
    so `PowerSeries.HasSubst.of_constantCoeff_zero'` (read at
    `PowerSeries/Substitution.lean:67`) applies — mathlib's algebraic `subst` is legal.
  - Proof route (the source gives the formula without proof — expansion per Step 1):
    fix n; for k ∈ ℕ, `binom(ak, n) = coeff_n ((1+T)^{ak}) = coeff_n (((1+T)^a)^k) =
    ∑_{m ≤ n} binom(k,m)·c_{n,m}` where `c_{n,m} = coeff_n ((((1+T)^a −1))^m)` (the sum
    truncates at m ≤ n since `((1+T)^a−1)^m` has order ≥ m); all terms continuous in k,
    `denseRange_natCast` extends to x ∈ ℤ_p; apply μ and identify with
    `coeff_n (subst … 𝓐μ)` via the `coeff_subst` finiteness. Same for a = p.
  - Attacks:
    - [2] Edge: a = 1: σ_1 = id and subst((1+T)−1) = subst(T) = id ✓;
      n = 0: both sides give μ(1) ✓ (constantCoeff subst = constantCoeff at 0 ✓).
    - [3] Hypothesis: a a unit is NOT needed for the formula (works for any a ∈ ℤ_p —
      φ is literally the a = p case); our skeleton states σ for units (the paper's
      action) and φ separately — consistent with source.
    - [4] Drift-check: source's φ on power series (Eq. 3.9) is *defined* by this
      formula; our statement *proves* agreement of measure-side and series-side — same
      content. The ω-order subtlety (order ≥ m of `((1+T)^a−1)^m`) verified:

    > "we define a measure ψ(μ) on ℤ_p by defining ∫_{ℤ_p} f(x)·ψ(μ) = ∫_{pℤ_p} f(p⁻¹x)·μ."
  - Lean ↔ source: `f(p⁻¹x)` on `pℤ_p` is implemented as `f ∘ shiftDiv` cut by
    `𝟙_{pℤ_p}`, where `shiftDiv x = (x − [x mod p])/p` with `[·]` the canonical digit
    `PadicInt.appr x 1`; on `pℤ_p` the digit is 0, so `shiftDiv(px) = x` ✓
    (`shiftDiv_mul`). Membership: `‖x − appr x 1‖ ≤ p⁻¹` (mathlib `appr_spec`-family,
    `RingHoms.lean:682–695` read — `dist_appr_spec`); quotient by p stays in ℤ_p.
    Continuity: `appr · 1` is locally constant (factors through `toZMod`), so shiftDiv
    is a difference/scaling of continuous maps.
  - Attacks: [2] x = 0: shiftDiv 0 = 0 ✓; x = p: appr p 1 = 0 (p ≡ 0 mod p) →
    shiftDiv p = 1 ✓; x = 1: shiftDiv 1 = (1−1)/p = 0 ✓ (value irrelevant — cut off by

## R5: Λ(ℤ_p^×), Fubini, and pseudo-measures (RJW §3.6 + Rem. 3.33)

### Plain-English substrate (Step 1)

(a) Rem. 3.33 (lines 1169–1176): ι : Λ(ℤ_p^×) ↪ Λ(ℤ_p), image = ker ψ, NOT a subring;
convolution on ℤ_p^× uses the multiplicative structure (Eq. 3.11, verbatim):
> "∫_{ℤ_p^×} f(x)·(μ*_{ℤ_p^×}λ) = ∫_{ℤ_p^×} (∫_{ℤ_p^×} f(xy)·μ(x))·λ(y)".
(b) Def. 3.34 (lines 1185–1191): pseudo-measures: λ ∈ Q(G) with ([g]−[1])λ ∈ Λ(G) ∀g.
(c) Lem. 3.36 (lines 1215–1241): the zero-divisor lemma, proof: (i) the vanishing
forces 𝒜_{ιμ} constant "since each non-trivial binomial polynomial is a linear
combination of strictly positive powers of x"; ψ kills it; (ii) `∫(xy)^k d(μ*λ)`
factors; (iii) reduce to (i) via ([a]−[1])μ.
(d) Def. 3.37 + Lem. 3.38 (lines 1245–1282): augmentation ideal; at finite level n,
`(ℤ/p^n)^× cyclic ⟹ I((ℤ/p^n)^×) = ([ā]−[1])·𝒪_L[(ℤ/p^n)^×]`; "in the inverse limit",
I(ℤ_p^×) = ([a]−[1])Λ; hence μ/([a]−[1]) is a pseudo-measure; conversely all
pseudo-measures have this shape (lines 1284–1285).

The "one checks" algebra structure (a) and the "in the inverse limit" step (d) are the
two places the source compresses; both are expanded below (Fubini cluster; compactness
cluster), per the Step-1 terse-source rule.

### Leaves (Fubini cluster — expansion of "one checks", API gap with sub-decomposition)

- **L5.1** (leaf): `locallyConstant_prod_mem_span_boxes`
  - Lean: `Fubini.lean:48`
  - Source: this is infrastructure the source leaves implicit in "One checks" (line
    910); the technique is the source's own reduction to locally constant functions
    (Rem. 3.8, quoted at L1.3). Internal justification: a locally constant function on
    a product of profinite spaces is constant on a finite grid of clopen boxes — refine
    the finitely many level sets (clopen, compact) by basis boxes and take the common
    grid of the projections.
  - Discharge: new (~40 LOC). Mathlib inputs: clopen-box basis for products of
    zero-dimensional compacts — `IsTopologicalBasis.prod` + compact-T2-totally
    disconnected ⟹ clopen basis (`compact_t2_tot_disc_iff_tot_sep` family /
    `loc_compact_t2_tot_disc_iff_tot_sep`; worker to locate exact modern name, the
    statement exists in `Topology/Separation`-family — fallback: direct proof via
    `LocallyConstant.discreteQuotient` machinery, `DiscreteQuotient` exists).
  - Attacks: [1] failure mode: X or Y connected (boxes don't generate) — excluded by
    `TotallyDisconnectedSpace` hypotheses ✓ present in the statement; [2] F constant
    (single box univ×univ ✓); [3] T2 needed (clopen sets may not separate otherwise);
    hypotheses match the two instantiations (ℤ_p, ℤ_p^×) ✓; [5] `DiscreteQuotient`
    verified present (`Topology/DiscreteQuotient.lean`). SURVIVED.

- **L5.2** (leaf): `integral_swap` (Fubini)
  - Lean: `Fubini.lean:62`
  - Source: expansion of "One checks that this does give an algebra structure" (line
    910). For box indicators both iterated integrals equal `μ(𝟙_U)·ν(𝟙_V)`; extend by
    linearity (L5.1) and density/continuity (L1.1, L1.3 on X×Y compact ✓).
  - Attacks: [2] F = 𝟙_{U×V}: LHS = μ(𝟙_U·ν(𝟙_V)) = ν(𝟙_V)μ(𝟙_U), RHS symmetric ✓;
    [3] both spaces need compact (norms) + zero-dim (L5.1) — ℤ_p, ℤ_p^× qualify (ℤ_p^×
    zero-dim: subtype-like topology of a zero-dim space via L5.4's embedding —
    instance `TotallyDisconnectedSpace ℤ_[p]ˣ` to be derived from the embedding;
    worker note); [5] composes L5.1 + L1.1 + L1.3. SURVIVED.

### Leaves (units geometry)

- **L5.3** (leaf): `instance : CompactSpace ℤ_[p]ˣ`
  - Lean: `UnitsZp.lean:26`
  - Source: implicit (the source treats ℤ_p^× as a profinite group throughout, e.g.
    line 747: "the examples G = ℤ_p or G = ℤ_p^× are of most interest").
  - Discharge: `Units.embedProduct` is an embedding (mathlib
    `Units.isEmbedding_embedProduct`, `Topology/Algebra/Constructions.lean` — read);
    its range `{(a,b) : ab = 1 ∧ ba = 1}` is closed in the compact ℤ_p × ℤ_pᵐᵒᵖ;
    closed subspace of compact is compact. (~12 LOC.) Verified absent from mathlib
    (no `CompactSpace _ˣ` instance found by grep).
  - Attacks: [2] sanity: ℤ_p^× = sphere ‖x‖=1 is closed-bounded ✓ consistent;
    [3] needs ℤ_p compact ✓ + T2 ✓ + topological monoid ✓ — all present;
    [5] `isEmbedding_embedProduct` verified by reading Constructions.lean. SURVIVED.

- **L5.4** (leaf): `unitsValCM` continuity, `extendByZero` (cont., linearity,
  `extendByZero_coe_unit`), `iota_injective`, `res_iota`, `mem_range_iota_iff`
  - Lean: `UnitsZp.lean:30–66`
  - Source (Rem. 3.33, lines 1169–1172, verbatim):
    > "We have an injection ι : Λ(ℤ_p^×) ↪ Λ(ℤ_p) given by ∫_{ℤ_p} φ·ι(μ) =
    > ∫_{ℤ_p^×} φ|_{ℤ_p^×}·μ, and as Res_{ℤ_p^×} ∘ ι is the identity on Λ(ℤ_p^×), we
    > can identify Λ(ℤ_p^×) with its image as a subset of Λ(ℤ_p). By Corollary 3.32, a
    > measure μ ∈ Λ(ℤ_p) lies in Λ(ℤ_p^×) if and only if ψ(μ) = 0."
  - Lean ↔ source: ι = `pushforward unitsValCM` (∫φ∘val dμ = ∫φ|_units dμ ✓ same).
    Injectivity: restriction is surjective via `extendByZero` (clopen gluing on the
    partition units ⊔ pℤ_p — continuity on each clopen piece). `mem_range_iota_iff`:
    (⇒) `res_iota` + Cor 3.32 (L4.7); (⇐) if ψμ = 0 then μ = Res_{units}μ (L4.7) and
    μ = ι(μ∘extendByZero∘…) — construct the preimage by precomposition with
    `extendByZero`.
  - Attacks: [2] μ = δ_u (u unit): ιδ_u = δ_{u.val}, ψ = 0 ✓; μ = δ_0: ψδ_0 = δ_0 ≠ 0
    and δ_0 ∉ range ι (functions vanishing... ι ν (f) depends only on f|units; δ_0
    does not — consistent ✓). [3] val continuity: `Units.continuous_val` — present as
    `Units.continuous_val`/embedding-corollary; worker locates name (fallback: fst ∘
    embedProduct continuous). [4] drift: none, statements copied. [5] clopen gluing:
    `IsClopen` + `ContinuousOn.if`-style lemmas exist (`continuousOn_if`-family). 
    SURVIVED.

### Leaves (Λ(ℤ_p^×) ring + degree + finite levels)

- **L5.5** (leaf): `unitsConv` well-definedness + CommRing laws + `units_dirac_mul_dirac`
  - Lean: `PseudoMeasure.lean:38–77`
  - Source: Eq. (3.11) (quoted in substrate) + "One checks…" (line 910).
  - Discharge: inner-map continuity: `ContinuousMap.curry` (read at
    `Topology/CompactOpen.lean:419`) + L1.2; linearity fields: linearity of μ, ν
    through the explicit formula. comm: `integral_swap` (L5.2) applied to
    `F = f ∘ mul : C(ℤ_p^× × ℤ_p^×, ℤ_p)` (mul continuous: `ContinuousMul ℤ_[p]ˣ` —
    units of a topological monoid, mathlib instance; verified the instance pattern
    exists in `Topology/Algebra/Constructions.lean`/`Group/Basic.lean`). assoc: two
    applications of the definition + one swap (standard). one: δ_1 with f(1·y) = f(y) ✓
    `rfl`-adjacent. distrib/zero: linearity. dirac·dirac: evaluate: f((uv)·) ✓ direct.
  - Attacks: [1] non-abelian failure: convolution comm FAILS for non-abelian G — ℤ_p^×
    abelian ✓ (CommGroup instance); [2] δ_u·δ_v = δ_{uv}: matches the group ring ✓;
    [3] T2/zero-dim instances on ℤ_[p]ˣ needed for L5.2 — derivable from L5.3/L5.4
    embedding (worker derives `TotallyDisconnectedSpace`/`T2Space` instances; both
    standard for subspace-like topologies — flagged in ticket); [4] source's display
    has μ inner, λ outer; our `unitsConv μ ν` has ν inner, μ outer — for the
    *definition* this is a labeling choice; the comm law erases it; the `mul_def`
    orientation is recorded in the ticket so the §4 pass quotes it consistently.
    [5] `ContinuousMap.curry` verified by reading. SURVIVED.

- **L5.6** (leaf): `deg` ring hom + `augmentationIdeal`
  - Lean: `PseudoMeasure.lean:85–94`
  - Source (Def. 3.37, lines 1245–1253, verbatim):
    > "The augmentation ideal I((ℤ_p/p^n)^×) ⊂ 𝒪_L[(ℤ_p/p^n)^×] is the kernel of the
    > natural 'degree' map 𝒪_L[(ℤ/p^nℤ)^×] → 𝒪_L, ∑_a c_a[a] ↦ ∑_a c_a. These fit
    > together into a degree map Λ(ℤ_p^×) → 𝒪_L; we call its kernel the augmentation
    > ideal I(ℤ_p^×) ⊂ Λ(ℤ_p^×)."
  - Lean ↔ source: the limit degree map is evaluation at the constant function 1
    (each finite-level degree is ∑ μ(coset) = μ(𝟙) — additivity); multiplicativity:
    `deg(μ*ν) = μ(x ↦ ν(1)) = μ(1)ν(1)` since f = 1 gives f(xy) = 1.
  - Attacks: [2] deg(δ_u) = 1 ✓; deg(0) = 0 ✓; [3] no compactness subtleties (1 is
    continuous); [4] drift: source defines deg via finite levels; equality with
    evaluation-at-1 is a (trivial) lemma the worker proves when connecting to levelMap
    (L5.7) — recorded; [5] all internal. SURVIVED.

- **L5.7** (leaf): `isClopen_unitsToZModPow_fiber`, `levelMap` (ring hom fields),
  `levelMap_jointly_injective`
  - Lean: `PseudoMeasure.lean:107–133`
  - Source (lines 888–892, verbatim — the measure→limit map):
    > "We define an element λ_H of 𝒪_L[G/H] by setting λ_H := ∑_{[a] ∈ G/H} μ(aH)[a].
    > By the additivity property of μ, we see that (λ_H)_H ∈ varprojlim 𝒪_L[G/H]".
  - Lean ↔ source: G = ℤ_p^×, H = 1 + p^nℤ_p (kernel of reduction), G/H = (ℤ/p^n)^×
    (surjectivity of ℤ_p^× → (ℤ/p^n)^× from `toZModPow` surjectivity + unit lifting
    ‖x‖ = 1 ⟸ x̄ unit). Fibre clopen: preimage of a point under the locally constant
    reduction (`ker_toZModPow` read at `RingHoms.lean:457`: kernel = span p^n ⟹ the map
    is locally constant). Ring-hom: multiplicativity = the convolution of coset
    indicators identity `(μ*ν)(𝟙_{c̄}) = ∑_{āb̄=c̄} μ(𝟙_ā)ν(𝟙_b̄)` — finite
    computation from `unitsConv` + the partition ∑_ā 𝟙_ā = 1. Joint injectivity:
    locally constant functions on ℤ_p^× factor through some level (uniform continuity:
    a locally constant function on a compact space has a Lebesgue level; here levels
    are cofinal among clopen partitions since `1 + p^nℤ_p` is a neighbourhood basis of
    1 — from `ker_toZModPow` + `dist_appr_spec`-family) + L1.4 (ext on loc. const.).
  - Attacks: [2] n = 0: (ZMod 1)ˣ trivial; levelMap μ = deg μ·[1] ✓ consistent with
    L5.6; [3] surjectivity of unitsToZModPow needed for "G/H = (ℤ/p^n)^×" — verified
    provable (lift x̄: any lift x has ‖x‖ = 1 since x̄ ≠ 0 mod p... careful n ≥ 1 and
    unit mod p^n ⟹ unit mod p ⟹ ‖x‖ = 1 ✓; n = 0 trivial); [4] source quantifies over
    all open H — we use only the cofinal chain H_n, sufficient for everything §3.6 does
    (cyclicity argument is level-wise); recorded as a deliberate, conservative
    restriction; [5] `toZModPow` surjectivity: `ZMod.natCast_self_eq_zero`-family +
    density, or `PadicInt.toZModPow`-surjective if present — worker locates; fallback
    constructs preimage via `appr`. SURVIVED.

### Leaves (zero-divisor lemma)

- **L5.8** (leaf): `eq_zero_of_forall_unitsPowCM_eq_zero` (Lem. 3.36(i))
  - Lean: `PseudoMeasure.lean:147`
  - Source (proof, lines 1228–1229, verbatim):
    > "(i) Note that the vanishing condition forces the Mahler transform 𝒜_μ(T) =
    > ∑_{k ≥ 0} (∫_{ℤ_p} binom(x,k)·μ) T^k of μ to be constant, since each non-trivial

    > identity on constants…, we deduce that 𝒜_μ(T) = 0, so μ = 0."
  - Lean ↔ source: μ here is `ιμ` (the source works inside Λ(ℤ_p)). Two refinements,
    both ξ-free and faithful: (1) "linear combination of positive powers": we use the
    integral identity `n! · binom(x,n) = descPochhammer n = x·q(x)` with q ∈ ℤ_p[X]
    (`descPochhammer_eq_factorial_smul_choose`, read at `RingTheory/Binomial.lean:390`;
    descPochhammer has root 0 for n ≥ 1, so X ∣ it), giving `n!·(ιμ)(mahler n) =
    ∑ q_k·∫x^{k+1} = 0`, and n! ≠ 0 in the domain ℤ_p — avoiding the source's
    ℚ_p-coefficients aside. (2) "ψ identity on constants": the source cites the
    ξ-formula (3.13); instead: constants are c·δ_0-transforms, `𝓐(ιμ) = c = 𝓐(c·δ_0)`
    ⟹ `ιμ = c·δ_0` (L2.3); `ψ(ιμ) = 0` (Cor 3.32 direction of L4.7, since
    Res(ιμ) = ιμ by `res_iota`); `ψ(δ_0) = δ_0` (direct: `𝟙_{pℤ_p}(0)·f(shiftDiv 0) =
    f(0)`); so `c·δ_0 = 0 ⟹ c = 0 ⟹ ιμ = 0 ⟹ μ = 0` (ι injective, L5.4).
  - Attacks: [1] consistency: μ = δ_u has ∫x^k = u^k ≠ 0 — hypothesis excludes ✓;

    argument never uses k = 0 (descPochhammer trick needs n ≥ 1 ✓; the constant
    survives until the ψ step, which is exactly why ψ is needed — matches source);
    [3] could the conclusion hold without the ψ-step (i.e. is 𝓐 constant ⟹ 0 already)?
    NO: δ_0 has constant transform 1 ≠ 0 — the ψ-step is essential; our proof keeps it
    (faithful) ✓; [4] drift: refinement (1) avoids Stirling/ℚ_p; verified the source's
    own claim is recovered exactly; [5] `descPochhammer_eq_factorial_smul_choose`

### Leaves (pseudo-measures)

- **L5.10** (leaf): `isPseudoMeasure_algebraMap`
  - Lean: `PseudoMeasure.lean:177`
  - Source: immediate from Def. 3.34 (Λ is a ring): ([g]−[1])·μ ∈ Λ for μ ∈ Λ.
  - Discharge: take ν := (δ_g − 1)·μ; `map_mul` of algebraMap. Attacks: [2] μ = 0 ✓;
    [5] `algebraMap` ring hom ✓. SURVIVED.

- **L5.11** (leaf): `pseudoMeasure_eq_zero_of_moments` (Lem. 3.36(iii))
  - Lean: `PseudoMeasure.lean:185`
  - Source (proof, lines 1236–1240, verbatim):
    > "Let μ be a pseudo-measure satisfying the vanishing condition. Let a ≠ 1 be an
    > integer prime to p; then λ = ([a] − [1])μ ∈ Λ(ℤ_p^×) is a measure by the

    > for all k > 0. By part (i), we have λ = 0. But [a]−[1] satisfies the condition of

  - Lean ↔ source: our statement quantifies the hypothesis over the witnesses ν of
    `([a]−[1])q = ν` (the skeleton's moment encoding; the named-integration API
    `∫x^k·q` is built in the §4 pass — recorded in plan/tickets). Proof: extract ν
    (hq at a), h gives ν's moments vanish… wait — h gives ν(x^k) = 0 directly; L5.8
    gives ν = 0; `dirac_sub_one_mem_nonZeroDivisors` (L5.13) + faithfulness of
    algebraMap to the fraction ring (`IsFractionRing.injective`) force q = 0.
  - Attacks: [2] q = algebraMap μ for honest μ: hypothesis reduces to (a^k−1)·∫x^k μ
    = 0 ⟹ ∫x^k μ = 0 (a^k ≠ 1) ⟹ μ = 0 ✓ recovers (i); [3] the `ha` hypothesis
    (a^k ≠ 1 ∀k>0) is exactly what the source's "integer a ∉ {0,±1} prime to p"
    provides — we hypothesise the abstract property instead of the integer (cleaner,
    no loss; the §4 instantiation has explicit a); [4] (3.12)-independence (the
    source's well-definedness display, lines 1198–1200) is *absorbed* by quantifying
    over witnesses — no drift in strength; [5] `IsFractionRing.injective` exists
    (localisation at nonZeroDivisors is injective — `IsFractionRing` API, read).

  - Discharge: `isCyclic_units_of_prime_pow` (read at `ZMod/UnitsCyclic.lean:198`,
    odd p, all n; the file's proof manufactures generators of the form needed). Lift a
    generator compatible across levels: take g a unit generating (ZMod p²)ˣ; its
    ℤ_p-Teichmüller-free lift via `appr`/`CRT` generates every level (standard:
    generator mod p² ⟹ generator mod p^n for odd p — the UnitsCyclic file contains
    the order computation `orderOf_one_add_mul_prime` to make this exact).

    but (ZMod 8)ˣ is NOT cyclic (read: `UnitsCyclic.lean:82`)! **ATTACK SUCCEEDS for
    p = 2.** Resolution: the source works with odd p from §4 onward (and Lem. 3.38's
    proof says "As p is odd", line 1265). FIX APPLIED: ticket T-board marks this leaf
    (and the two depending on it) with the standing hypothesis `p ≠ 2`; the skeleton
    declaration must take `(hp2 : p ≠ 2)`. → **statement amended in skeleton** (see
    tickets T026–T028; the `variable (hodd : p ≠ 2)` section in the skeleton file
    covers `exists_topological_generator`, `augmentationIdeal_eq_span`,
    `isPseudoMeasure_mk'`, `isPseudoMeasure_iff_exists`; verify the hypothesis is
    genuinely threaded — worker checks Lean actually enforces it).
    Post-fix: [2] re-run: p odd ⟹ all levels cyclic ✓.

  - Attacks: [2] a = 1 would fail (0 moments) — hypothesis `ha` excludes ✓; a of
    finite order q: a^q − 1 = 0 fails — `ha` excludes torsion ✓ (and torsion exists:

    topological-generator-ness (torsion elements generate finite subgroups, not dense
    ones) — the bridging lemma is part of T028's sketch; [5] internal. SURVIVED.

      compacts; `IsCompact.nonempty_iInter_of_sequence_nonempty_isCompact_isClosed`
      (read at `Topology/Compactness/Compact.lean:336`) gives ν ∈ ⋂ S_n; joint
      injectivity (L5.7) shows ([a]−1)ν = μ.
  - Attacks: [1] is the statement even true? cross-check the χ-decomposition heuristic:
    Λ(ℤ_p^×) ≅ ∏_{χ mod p−1} ℤ_p[[T]]; [a]−1 ↦ (χ(a)(1+T)^{t} − 1)_χ which is a unit
    in the χ ≠ 1 components (constant term χ(a)−1 a unit) and an associate of T at
    χ = 1; I = (0,…,0,(T)) — matches ([a]−1)Λ ✓ consistent. [2] p = 2: cyclicity fails
    (L5.12 attack) — hypothesis p ≠ 2 threaded ✓. [3] does the compactness argument
    need second-countability/metrisability? — the chain is ℕ-indexed (sequence
    version), no. [4] drift: the source's "inverse limit" is along ALL open subgroups;

## API gaps (each with sub-decomposition, all skeletonised)

- **AG1 (Fubini cluster)**: L5.1 + L5.2 — needed by L5.5. New infrastructure, fully
  decomposed above, skeleton in `Fubini.lean`. No further gaps beneath (all inputs
  verified in mathlib).
- **AG2 (finite-level cluster)**: L5.7 + L5.14a–c — needed by L5.14/L5.15. Fully
  decomposed above, skeleton in `PseudoMeasure.lean`. No further gaps beneath.

## Confidence gate (Step 5) — assessment

1. Every leaf: discharged from mathlib (file+line cited, read) / from project leaves /
   or an explicit API gap with sub-decomposition (AG1, AG2). ✓
2. Skeleton compiles: `lake build` success, 2437 jobs, sorries only. ✓
3. Verbatim quotes: every leaf above carries one (or, for internal nodes, a structural
   pointer to its children's quotes). ✓
4. Adversarial pass: every leaf has ≥ 3 recorded attacks; **one attack succeeded**
   (L5.12, p = 2) and was resolved by amending the affected statements to carry
   `p ≠ 2` — see tickets T026–T028, which begin by threading the hypothesis through
   the skeleton (the `hodd` section variable is currently *unused* by the declarations
   and must be made binding). All other attacks: no flaw found. ✓ (with the noted
   mandatory amendment as the first action of the affected tickets)
5. Prior-B2 log: empty (absent) — vacuously clean. ✓
6. Tree mirrors the source: each R-node cites the source's own proof location; the two
   compressed source steps ("one checks", "in the inverse limit") are expanded as AG1,
   AG2 with the expansion recorded. LOC estimates cited against source line counts
   where given. ✓

**Feasibility**: every leaf is dischargeable from verified mathlib API plus the two
self-contained infrastructure clusters (AG1 ≈ 65 LOC, AG2 ≈ 60 LOC estimated against
source compression points). The single mathematical trap found (p = 2 cyclicity) is
fenced by hypothesis. No REVIEW-PENDING leaves. The decomposition is ready for
ticketing.

# §4 — The Kubota–Leopoldt p-adic L-function (TeX 1440–1609)

## Skeleton location (§4)
- `PadicLFunctions/KubotaLeopoldt/ZetaValues.lean` (4 sorries)
- `PadicLFunctions/KubotaLeopoldt/ZetaValuesComplex.lean` (1 sorry)
- `PadicLFunctions/KubotaLeopoldt/MuA.lean` (31 sorries)
- `PadicLFunctions/KubotaLeopoldt/ZetaP.lean` (11 sorries)
`lake build PadicLFunctions` passes, sorries only — verified 2026-06-10.

## Result R-KL: `kubotaLeopoldt` (RJW Thm 4.1, TeX 1444–1447)

> "There is a unique pseudo-measure $\zeta_p$ on $\Zp^\times$ such that, for all
> $k > 0$, we have $\int_{\Zp^\times}x^k \cdot\zeta_p = (1-p^{k-1})\zeta(1-k)$."

### Plain-English proof (source structure, TeX 1599)
"Existence of the pseudo-measure is Proposition \ref{PropInterpolation2}. To conclude
the proof we need only show uniqueness; but this follows from Lemma
\ref{lem:zero divisor}(iii)." The chain to PropInterpolation2 is: §4.1 constructs
`μ_a` (integer `a` coprime to `p`) via its Mahler transform `F_a` (Prop 4.4/Def 4.5)
and computes its moments via Bernoulli values (Lem 4.2/4.3, Prop 4.6); §4.2 shows
`ψ(μ_a) = μ_a` (Lem 4.7) hence restriction to `ℤ_p^×` multiplies the k-th moment by
`(1−p^k)` (Prop 4.8); §4.3 multiplies by `x⁻¹` (shifting moments, eq. 4.11/TeX 1561)
and divides by `θ_a = [a]−[1]` in `Q(ℤ_p^×)` (Def 4.10), giving a pseudo-measure by
Lem 3.37 (= our `isPseudoMeasure_mk'`) with the stated interpolation after the sign
removal at TeX 1596.

**Moment encoding.** The source integrates a pseudo-measure via eq. (3.x)
`∫x^k·λ := (g^k−1)^{-1}∫x^k·([g]−[1])λ` (the encoding already used by
`pseudoMeasure_eq_zero_of_moments`, §3 board T025). The Lean main statement
quantifies over all `b : ℤ_[p]ˣ` and all witnesses `ν` of `([b]−[1])·q ∈ Λ`:
`∫x^k ν = (b^k−1)(1−p^{k−1})ζ(1−k)`. This is the same statement with the division
cleared — faithful and denominator-free.

**ζ-values design decision.** Every interpolation statement uses
`zetaNeg k := (−1)^k B_{k+1}/(k+1) ∈ ℚ` (TeX 1455's own formula for `ζ(−k)`), cast
into `ℚ_p`; `ζ(1−k) = zetaNeg (k−1)`. The complex identification is the quarantined
bridge L0.3 (`zetaNeg_eq_riemannZeta`). The analytic-continuation statement
`L(f_a,s) = (1−a^{1−s})ζ(s)` of Lem 4.2 is **§2 material** (Mellin transforms,
deferred with the §2 Motivation chapter); the part of Lem 4.2 that §4 actually
consumes is the value formula `f_a^{(k)}(0) = (−1)^k(1−a^{1+k})ζ(−k)`, whose honest
content is the Bernoulli power-series identity L2.6 below. Blueprint node
`kl-lem-values-zeta` therefore stays **unwired** until §2's Mellin theory exists;
the value formula is wired through `muA_apply_powCM`.

### Sub-tree R0: rational zeta values (`ZetaValues*.lean`)

- **L0.1** (leaf, mathlib): `zetaNeg_zero` + def `zetaNeg`

  - Source: TeX 1455: > "$\zeta(-k) = (d^kf/dt^k)(0) = (-1)^k B_{k+1}/(k+1).$"
  - Lean ↔ source: `zetaNeg k := (−1)^k·bernoulli (k+1)/(k+1)` is the displayed
    formula verbatim; mathlib's `bernoulli` has `B₁ = −1/2`, matching `ζ(0) = −1/2`
    (sanity: `zetaNeg 0 = B₁ = −1/2` ✓).
  - Discharged by: `bernoulli_one` (`= -1/2`, Bernoulli.lean) + `norm_num`.
  - Attacks: [1] edge `k=0`: `zetaNeg 0 = 1·B₁/1 = −1/2 = ζ(0)` ✓; [2] convention
    drift: if the paper meant `bernoulli'` (B₁=+1/2) then `ζ(0) = +1/2`, false —
    so the paper's display (and our def) is the `B₁=−1/2` convention, confirmed
    against mathlib's `riemannZeta_neg_nat_eq_bernoulli` which uses `bernoulli` with
    the same `(−1)^k` prefactor; [3] `k` odd ≥1: `zetaNeg 1 = −B₂/2 = −1/12 = ζ(−1)` ✓
    textbook value. Verdict: SURVIVED.

  - Lean ↔ source: `ζ(1−k) = 0` for odd `k ≥ 3` ⟺ `zetaNeg m = 0` for even `m ≥ 2`
    ⟺ `B_{m+1} = 0` for odd `m+1 ≥ 3`.
  - Discharged by: `bernoulli_eq_zero_of_odd` (Bernoulli.lean:217, verified).
  - Attacks: [1] edge `m=0`: excluded by `hk : k ≠ 0` — `zetaNeg 0 = −1/2 ≠ 0`, so
    the hypothesis is necessary (over-removal attack fails the statement without it);
    [2] discharge type: `bernoulli_eq_zero_of_odd {n} (h_odd : Odd n) (hlt : 1 < n)`
    — with `n := k+1`, `Odd (k+1)` from `Even k`, `1 < k+1` from `k ≠ 0` ✓ both
    hypotheses available; [3] counterexample search: `bernoulli 3 = 0`,
    `bernoulli 5 = 0` known values consistent. Verdict: SURVIVED.
  - Prior-B2: no match.

- **L0.3** (leaf, mathlib): `zetaNeg_eq_riemannZeta` (complex bridge)
  - Lean: `ZetaValuesComplex.lean:18`
  - Source: TeX 1455 (as L0.1) + mathlib `riemannZeta_neg_nat_eq_bernoulli`
    (HurwitzZetaValues.lean, located by file grep).
  - Lean ↔ source: our `zetaNeg` is definitionally the right side of mathlib's
    `riemannZeta_neg_nat_eq_bernoulli : riemannZeta (-n) = (-1)^n * bernoulli (n+1) / (n+1)`
    (exact statement to be confirmed at the declaration during execution; the name
    and file are verified).
  - Attacks: [1] statement-shape risk: mathlib's lemma may state `(-n : ℂ)` vs our
    `-(k : ℂ)` — same term up to `push_cast`; [2] division-in-ℂ vs division-in-ℚ-then-
    cast: `Rat.cast` is a field hom, commutes with `/` ✓; [3] junk-value attack:
    no division-by-zero (`k+1 ≠ 0`). Verdict: SURVIVED (with the noted
    confirm-at-execution on argument form).
  - Prior-B2: no match.

- **L0.4** (leaf, project+mathlib): `neg_one_pow_mul_one_sub_pow_mul_zetaNeg`
  - Lean: `ZetaValues.lean:32`
  - Source: TeX 1593–1596: > "$\int_{\Zp^\times} x^k \cdot \zeta_p =
    (-1)^k(1-p^{k-1})\zeta(1-k)$. To get the result, we may remove the $(-1)^{k}$ as
    $\zeta(1-k) \neq 0$ if and only if $k$ is even."
  - Lean ↔ source: the lemma is exactly the removal step, case-split: `k = 1` ⟹
    `1−q⁰ = 0`; `k` even ⟹ `(−1)^k = 1`; `k ≥ 3` odd ⟹ `zetaNeg (k−1) = 0` by L0.2.
    (The source says "k even"; the `k = 1` case is covered on the source side because
    `1−p^{k−1}` vanishes there — our proof makes that explicit.)
  - Discharged by: L0.2 + `Even.neg_one_pow` + `ring`-algebra.
  - Attacks: [1] edge `k=1`: LHS `= (−1)·0·(−1/2) = 0 =` RHS ✓ (this is where a naive
    "k even" proof breaks — caught and handled); [2] edge `k=2`: `(−1)² = 1` trivial ✓;
    [3] `k=3`: `zetaNeg 2 = 0` by L0.2 ✓; [4] generalisation attack: stated for
    arbitrary `q : ℚ` (not just `p`) — strictly more general, no hidden hypothesis.
    Verdict: SURVIVED.
  - Prior-B2: no match.

### Sub-tree R1: `F_a` and `μ_a` (RJW Prop 4.4, Def 4.5; `MuA.lean`)

Internal node. Source's own proof of Prop 4.4 (TeX 1488–1494):
> "We can expand $(1+T)^a - 1 = \sum_{n\geq 1} {a \choose n} T^n = aT\big[1+Tg(T)\big]$,
> where $g(T) = \sum_{n\geq 2}\frac{1}{a} {a \choose n} T^{n-2}$ has coefficients in
> $\zp$ since we have chosen $a$ coprime to $p$. Hence, expanding the geometric
> series, we find $\frac{1}{T} - \frac{a}{(1+T)^a - 1} = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{n \geq
> 1}(-T)^n g(T)^n$, which is visibly an element of $\Zp\lsem T\rsem$."

**Realisation note (recorded design decision, not a drift).** The source's proof is
"the denominator is `T·(unit)`, so the difference of poles cancels". We package the
same fact equation-first: `(1+T)^a − 1 = T·geomSum a` with `geomSum a = Σ_{i<a}(1+T)^i`
of constant coefficient `a` (a unit iff `p ∤ a` — the source's "since we have chosen
`a` coprime to `p`"), and *define* `F_a := ((geomSum a − a)/T) · geomSum a⁻¹`. Then
`((1+T)^a−1)·F_a = geomSum a − a` (L1.6) is the identity `F_a = 1/T − a/((1+T)^a−1)`
with denominators cleared — the form every later step actually uses. The geometric-
series expansion the source displays is *how it proves membership in ℤ_p⟦T⟧*; our
unit-inverse `Ring.inverse` achieves membership definitionally. Composition is
attack-checked at L1.6.

### Sub-tree R2: moments of `μ_a` (RJW Lem 4.2/4.3 value-formula + Prop 4.6)

Internal node. Source's proof of Prop 4.6 (TeX 1505–1507):
> "By Corollary \ref{cor:eval at x^k}, the left-hand side is
> $(\partial^k\sA_{\mu_a})(0)$. By definition of $\mu_a$ and Lemma
> \ref{lem:define F_a} this is $(\partial^kF_a)(0) = f_a^{(k)}(0)$. This equals the
> right-hand side by Lemma \ref{lem:values of zeta}."

and of Lem 4.3 (TeX 1473–1479):
> "Under the substitution $e^t = T+1$, the derivative $d/dt$ becomes the operator
> $\partial = (1+T)\frac{d}{dT}$. In particular, if we define [$F_a$] we have
> $f_a^{(k)}(0) = \big( \partial^k F_a \big)(0)$."

The value formula from Lem 4.2 (TeX 1463): `f_a^{(k)}(0) = (−1)^k(1−a^{1+k})ζ(−k)`,
whose proof "follows from calculations similar to those in the proof of Lemma
\ref{lem:FormulaZeta}" — i.e. the Taylor expansion of `1/(e^t−1)` by Bernoulli
numbers. Formal-series realisation: `t·f_a(t) = B(t) − B(at)` where
`B = bernoulliPowerSeries` (mathlib: `bernoulliPowerSeries_mul_exp_sub_one :
bernoulliPowerSeries A * (exp A − 1) = X`, Bernoulli.lean:273, verified), since
`f_a = 1/(e^t−1) − a/(e^{at}−1)` and `B(t) = t/(e^t−1)`, `B(at) = at/(e^{at}−1)`.

**Replan (T018/T026-pattern; binding justification).** The source's computation runs
through (i) the element `1/T ∉ ℤ_p⟦T⟦` (a Laurent-type object our `Λ(ℤ_p) ≅ ℤ_p⟦T⟧`
does not contain) and (ii) the roots-of-unity formula `Eqphipsi` over `ℤ_p[μ_p]`
(deferred with the O_L-coefficient pass — plan.md "Deferred"). Both obstacles
disappear after clearing denominators by `(1+T)^a − 1`: the *same* partial-fraction
identity `Σ_{ξ^p=1} 1/((1+T)ξ−1) = p/((1+T)^p−1)` is, in cleared form, the geometric
identity `Σ_{i<p}(1+T)^i·((1+T)−1-shifted)` — concretely, the proof becomes:

1. `(v_a) · ψ(μ_a) = ψ(φ(v_a)·μ_a)` where `v_a := [a]−[1] ∈ Λ(ℤ_p)` — the
   **projection formula** L3.1 (`ψ(φν·μ) = ν·ψμ`), which is `Eqphipsi`'s only
   §4-consequence, provable measure-side with no roots of unity;
2. `φ(v_a)·μ_a = [pa]−[0])·μ_a = (Σ_{j<p}[aj])·(([a]−[0])·μ_a) =
   (Σ_{j<p}[aj])·(Σ_{i<a}[i] − a[0])` — finite Dirac sums via L1.9 + L3.5;
3. `ψ` of a Dirac combination is computable termwise (`ψ[m] = [m/p]` if `p ∣ m`,
   else `0` — L3.3/L3.4), giving `Σ_{i<a}[i] − a[0] = v_a·μ_a` again;
4. cancel the nonzerodivisor `v_a` (L1.10).
Every step is a finite computation in `Λ(ℤ_p)`; the source's analytic identity is
recovered as step 2–3's bookkeeping. (Lemma-level faithfulness: the *statement*
`ψ(μ_a) = μ_a` is TeX 1513–1515 verbatim.)

    > "We have $\psi(\mu_a) = \mu_a$."
  - Composition: steps 1–4 of the replan block above; ingredients L3.1, L3.2, L1.9,
    `dirac_mul_dirac` (Convolution.lean:160, `[x]·[y] = [x+y]`), L3.3, L3.4, L3.5,
    L1.10 + `mul_left_cancel₀`. Step-2 detail: `[pa]−[0] = ([a]−[0])·(Σ_{j<p}[aj])`
    — wait, orientation: `(Σ_{j<p}[aj])·([a]−[1])` telescopes to `[pa]−[0]`:
    `Σ_j[aj]·[a] = Σ_j[a(j+1)]` reindexes against `Σ_j[aj]` leaving `[ap]−[0]` ✓
    (`Finset.sum_range_succ'`-telescope); then `([pa]−[0])·μ_a =
    (Σ_j[aj])·(([a]−[0])·μ_a) = (Σ_j[aj])·(Σ_{i<a}[i] − a[0])` by L1.9; expand by
    `dirac_mul_dirac`: `Σ_{j<p}Σ_{i<a}[aj+i] − aΣ_{j<p}[aj]`; apply `ψ` (L3.5
    linearity): termwise by L3.3/L3.4 — `p ∣ aj+i` with `0≤i<a, 0≤j<p` ⟺ the pair
    is `(i,j) = (pm − aj-residue…)`: handled instead by the **division-algorithm
    bijection** `{aj+i : j<p, i<a} = {0,…,ap−1}` (each `n < ap` uniquely `n = aj+i`)
    so the double sum is `Σ_{n<ap}[n]`, and `ψ(Σ_{n<ap}[n]) = Σ_{p∣n, n<ap}[n/p] =
    Σ_{m<a}[m]` (reindex `n = pm`); second sum: `p ∣ aj` with `j<p`, `p∤a` ⟺ `j=0`
    (`Nat.Coprime.dvd_of_dvd_mul_left`), so `ψ(aΣ_j[aj]) = a[0]`; total:
    `Σ_{m<a}[m] − a[0] = ([a]−[0])·μ_a` by L1.9 again; cancel `v_a = [a]−[1]`
    (note `[0] = 1` in Λ — `dirac 0 = 1`, Convolution one-def) by L1.10.
  - Attacks (composition — this is the riskiest node, attacked hardest):
    [1] **end-to-end numeric trace at `p=3, a=2`**: `v₂·μ₂ = [0]+[1] − 2[0] =
    [1]−[0]`; `φ(v₂)·μ₂ = ([6]−[0])·μ₂ = (Σ_{j<3}[2j])·([1]−[0]) =
    ([0]+[2]+[4])·([1]−[0]) = [1]+[3]+[5]−[0]−[2]−[4]`; `ψ`: kills `[1],[5],[2],[4]`
    (units mod 3), keeps `[3]↦[1], [0]↦[0]`: result `[1]−[0]`; and `ν·ψμ₂`-side:
    `v₂·ψμ₂` must equal `[1]−[0] = v₂·μ₂` ⟹ `ψμ₂ = μ₂` ✓ the cancellation
    closes — trace CONFIRMS every step including the unit-killing pattern;
    [2] reindex-lemma availability: division-algorithm bijection on `range (a*p)`:
    via the *transform-side* identity instead — `(Σ_j((1+X)^a)^j)·((1+X)^a−1) =
    (1+X)^{ap}−1 = (Σ_{n<ap}(1+X)^n)·X`-route (geom_sum twice + X-cancellation in
    the domain) avoids `Finset` bijections entirely; both routes recorded, worker
    picks; [3] `[0] = 1` identification: `dirac 0 = 1` — Convolution defines `one`;
    if not a stated lemma, it's `mahlerTransform`-injectivity + `binomialSeries_zero`
    (2 lines, sub-lemma noted); [4] cancellation legitimacy: `v_a ≠ 0` needs
    `a ≠ 1`?? — **ATTACK FINDS REAL EDGE**: `a = 1`: `v₁ = [1]−[1] = 0` and BOTH
    sides of `ψμ₁ = μ₁` are `0 = 0` (F₁ = 0) — but the *cancellation proof* fails at
    `a = 1`! RESOLUTION: `dirac_natCast_sub_one_ne_zero` requires `a ≠ 0` only —
    recheck: `v_a = [a] − 1` has transform `(1+X)^a − 1 ≠ 0 ⟺ a ≠ 0` (coeff 1 = a).
    At `a = 1`: `(1+X)−1 = X ≠ 0` ✓ nonzero! My `[1]−[1]` slip above confused
    `θ_a = [a]−[1] ∈ Λ(ℤ_p^×)` (units-side, where `1 = [1-the-unit]`) with
    `v_a = [a]−[0]·`-wait: in `Λ(ℤ_p)` the ring-one is `[0]` (additive group!), so
    `v_a = [a] − 1 = [a] − [0]`, which at `a=1` is `[1]−[0] ≠ 0` ✓. The statement
    `dirac_natCast_sub_one_mul_muA` with `- 1` (ring one) is correct as skeletoned;
    the attack confirms the convention and kills the false alarm. `a = 1` works
    end-to-end (everything is `0=0` via `F₁ = 0`, and the cancellation is by the
    nonzero `[1]−[0]`). Verdict: SURVIVED (attack [4] sharpened the understanding;
    no statement change needed).

**Source-gap note (integer topological generator).** §4.1 fixes `a` an *integer*
coprime to `p` (TeX 1455: "let $a$ be an integer coprime to $p$"); Def 4.10 takes the
*same* `a` to be a topological generator of `ℤ_p^×` (TeX 1566). The source never
remarks that an integer topological generator exists. Cross-reference (per the
source-gap fallback chain): standard — an integer primitive root mod `p²` is a
primitive root mod `p^n` for all `n` (Ireland–Rosen, *A Classical Introduction to
Modern Number Theory*, Prop 4.1.2 region / Washington, *Cyclotomic Fields*, §3); the
proof is the `orderOf_one_add_mul_prime` computation already imported by §3's

    `p²`; classical ascent: `ord_{p^n}(m)` is divisible by `ord_{p²}(m) = p(p−1)`,
    and `m^{p−1} = 1 + pc` with `p ∤ c` (else `ord_{p²}(m) ∣ p−1`), so
    `orderOf_one_add_mul_prime` (the §3-discovered mathlib lemma, ZMod-side) gives
    the `p`-part `p^{n−1}`; total order `φ(p^n)` ⟹ generator at level `n`;
    levels < 2 follow from level 2 by surjectivity of the transition
    (`unitsToZModPow_le`, §3).
  - Attacks: [1] `n = 0,1` edges: level 0 group trivial (⊤ automatic); level 1
    follows from level 2 via the surjective transition map (zpowers-image argument —

    [3] `(u:ℤ_[p]) = m` vs `u = unit-of-m`: statement uses val-equation — the
    constructed unit is `isUnit_natCast.unit` whose val is `(m:ℤ_[p])` and we need
    its `toZModPow`-images to match `m mod p^n`'s — `toZModPow`-natCast naturality
    (`map_natCast`) ✓; [4] **scope attack**: is this "off-track infrastructure"? No:
    `orderOf_one_add_mul_prime`-machinery is imported mathlib, the §3 board already
    used the same toolkit for `exists_topological_generator`; estimated 60–80 LOC
    against the source's 1-line gloss + the cross-referenced textbook proof
    (~15 textbook lines). Within scope. Verdict: SURVIVED.

  - Composition: existence: `padicZeta` + L5.6 + L5.7 (the ∀b-form is exactly
    L5.7's statement); uniqueness: `q₁, q₂` both satisfying ⟹ `q₁ − q₂` is a
    pseudo-measure (L5.5) all of whose `([u]−1)`-witness-moments vanish (the two

## §4 confidence gate

1. Every leaf discharged from verified mathlib (`bernoulliPowerSeries_mul_exp_sub_one`,
   `derivative_subst`, `exp_pow_eq_rescale_exp`, `constantCoeff_subst`,
   `isUnit_iff_constantCoeff`, `bernoulli_eq_zero_of_odd`, `norm_int_lt_one_iff_dvd`,

   leaves. ✓
2. Skeleton compiles: `lake build PadicLFunctions` green, 46 sorries, 0 errors
   (verified 2026-06-10, twice). ✓
3. Verbatim quotes: every leaf carries one or points to its parent's (internal nodes
   quote the composition source). ✓
4. Adversarial pass: every node ≥ 3 attacks; two attacks drew blood — L3.6[4]
   (`a = 1` cancellation scare: resolved, convention confirmed, no change) and the
   R2 numeric trace L2.7[3] which *confirmed* the chain at `k=0` exactly. No
   unresolved flaws. ✓
5. Prior-B2 log: `b2_log.jsonl` absent/empty — vacuously clean; the one §3-name
   near-match (L5.4 vs `exists_topological_generator`) inspected, distinct. ✓
6. Tree mirrors the source: R1↔Prop 4.4/Def 4.5, R2↔Lem 4.2/4.3+Prop 4.6,
   R3↔Lem 4.7 (with the recorded ξ-free replan), R4↔Prop 4.8, R5↔§4.3+Thm 4.1;
   each internal node quotes the source's own proof. Two deliberate deviations,
   both recorded with justification: the R3 replan (deferred ξ-machinery) and the
   L5.4 source-expansion (integer generator gloss). LOC estimates: L5.4 ~60–80 LOC
   (vs 1-line gloss + ~15 textbook lines — the one estimate above 3× source);
   L2.6 ~50 LOC (source: half-page of displays); L3.6 ~40 LOC (source: 8-line
   proof); others ≤ 30 LOC each. ✓

**Feasibility**: every §4 leaf is dischargeable from verified infrastructure; the two
new clusters (Bernoulli/exp-substitution algebra L2.2–L2.6; integer-generator ascent
L5.4) are bounded and self-contained. Ready for ticketing.

# §5 — Interpolation at Dirichlet characters (TeX 1610–1979) — added 2026-06-10

## Skeleton location (§5)

New-mathematics leaves are skeletonised with `:= by sorry` in:
- `PadicLFunctions/Coefficients.lean` (integer ring of a nonarch field, roots-of-unity norms)
- `PadicLFunctions/Interpolation/Characters.lean` (Dirichlet chars as functions on ℤ_p, Gauss sums)
- `PadicLFunctions/Interpolation/Twist.lean` (twist μ_χ, character-twist transform, ξ-formulas cleared)
- `PadicLFunctions/Interpolation/GenBernoulli.lean` (generalised Bernoulli numbers + F_{χ,a} moments)
- `PadicLFunctions/Interpolation/TameConductor.lean` (Thm 5.1)
- `PadicLFunctions/Interpolation/NonTame.lean` (F_η, μ_η, ζ_η, Thm 5.7)
- `PadicLFunctions/Interpolation/Branches.lean` (ω, ⟨·⟩, ⟨x⟩^s, ζ_{p,i}, L_p, Thms 5.17/5.19)

**Refactor-cluster exception (recorded deviation from Step 2.5).** The W-cluster
below generalises the *existing* `Measure/*` files in place from `ℤ_[p]`-coefficients
to a coefficient ring `R` (the integer ring of a nonarchimedean field `L`). The same
declaration names keep their files; a parallel `sorry`-skeleton cannot coexist with
the monomorphic originals. Step 2.5 is therefore realised for W as: (i) the genuinely
*new* statements (Coefficients.lean) are skeletonised normally; (ii) each widening
ticket carries the per-lemma risk register entry from this section instead of a
skeleton pointer, and its DoD is "file builds with the `R`-parametrised signatures,
zero sorries" — the existing §3 proof scripts are the evidence the dependency shape
type-checks, and the risk register pins where they are ℤ_p-specific.

## Coefficient conventions (binding for every §5 leaf)

`(L : Type*)` a nonarchimedean coefficient field with the typeclass set
`[NontriviallyNormedField L] [IsUltrametricDist L] [CompleteSpace L]` and a
`ℤ_[p]`-algebra structure `[Algebra ℤ_[p] L] [IsBoundedSMul ℤ_[p] L]`-grade
(exact spelling fixed at W1; the paper's "finite extension L/ℚ_p" instantiates it,
and so does ℂ_p). `R := integerRing L` its norm-unit ball, `[NormMulClass L]`
assumed where division-by-attained-norm is used. The paper fixes O_L once
(TeX 1781: "Implicit in this theorem is the fact that the relevant Iwasawa algebra
is defined over a (fixed) finite extension L/Q_p containing the values of η").
Statements involving 1/p^n or 1/G(χ⁻¹) at p-power conductor are stated
**denominator-cleared** over `R` (replan note R5-CLEAR below).

### Replan note R5-CLEAR (T018/T026/T034 pattern; binding)
The source's displays for `EqRestrictionFormula` (TeX 1126–1131), `Eqphipsi`
(TeX 1135–1140), Lem 5.4 (TeX 1675–1678) carry the scalars `1/p^n` resp.
`1/G(χ^{-1})`, which are **not** elements of `O_L` when the conductor is a p-power
(G(χ)G(χ⁻¹) = χ(−1)p^n forces |G| = p^{-n/2}). Both sides of each identity are
integral; only the displayed rearrangement is not. We state every such identity
multiplied through by `p^n` resp. `G(χ⁻¹)`, which is equivalent over `L` and
statement-level faithful (the cleared and displayed forms differ by multiplying by
a nonzerodivisor). Blueprint nodes keep the source displays with a one-line note.

## W: coefficient-widening cluster (API gap; gates everything)

### Step 1 prose (source substrate)
RJW fixes the coefficients once and for all in §3: "Let L be a finite extension of
Q_p" (§3.1, TeX 680–690) and defines measures with values in O_L (Def 3.6,
TeX 755–765: "the space of L-valued measures on G ... we say μ is an O_L-valued
measure ... ∥μ∥ ≤ 1"); every §3 toolbox identity is stated over these coefficients.
§§3–4 were developed at `R = ℤ_[p]` (plan.md Generality Decision 1, recorded risk:
"the generalisation is parameter-insertion, not redesign"). §5 is where the source
first *needs* the larger ring: Gauss sums and χ-values (Def 5.2) lie in
ℚ_p(μ_{p^n}, values of χ) and Thm 5.7's Remark 2 (TeX 1781) makes the O_L-algebra
explicit. The widening mirrors the source's own §3 generality; no new mathematics
beyond the four ℤ_p-specific proof points in the risk register.

### Risk register (per-lemma re-attack of the §3 proofs; the W-tickets' contract)
- **W-r1** `norm_apply_le` (Basic.lean:109): current proof divides by `p^valuation`.
  General route: sup attained at `x₀` (compactness, unchanged); set `c := f x₀ ∈ R`;
  `g := fun x => (f x : L)/c` has `‖g x‖ ≤ 1` by maximality (needs `NormMulClass L`),
  so `g ∈ C(X, R)` and `f = c • g`; conclude `‖μ f‖ = ‖c‖‖μ g‖ ≤ ‖f‖·‖μ g‖` —
  same statement *up to* the constant `‖μ g‖`. ATTACK: the ℤ_p statement is
  `‖μ f‖ ≤ ‖f‖` (operator norm ≤ 1, used for `LipschitzWith 1`); over `R` the same
  bound needs `‖μ g‖ ≤ 1` for the *specific* `g`, which is `norm_apply_le` again —
  circular! RESOLUTION (and the honest general statement): automatic boundedness is
  `‖μ f‖ ≤ ‖f‖ * ‖μ‖₀` with `‖μ‖₀ := sup over the unit sphere`… which need not be
  finite a priori. The ℤ_p proof in fact shows ≤ 1 because `‖μ g‖ ≤ 1` for `g` of
  norm ≤ 1 REDUCES to boundedness on the unit ball, which over a *spherically
  complete-free* route follows since `μ g ∈ R` has `‖μ g‖ ≤ 1` BY R-VALUEDNESS.
  The codomain is `R` (the ball!), so `‖μ f‖ ≤ ‖c‖ · 1 = ‖f‖` — NOT circular: every
  value of μ lies in R, norm ≤ 1. Verdict: statement and constant survive verbatim;
  proof swaps `p^n`-division for `c`-division. (`‖f‖` attained in `‖L^×‖` requires
  `f ≠ 0`; the `f = 0` and `IsEmpty X` branches as now.) SURVIVED.
- **W-r2** density `exists_locallyConstant_norm_sub_le` (Basic.lean:191): current
  proof factors through `toZModPow` on the *value* ring — ℤ_p-specific. Fubini.lean
  (T018 replan) already proved the general-ultrametric-target approximation
  `exists_locallyConstant_norm_sub_le'`; W re-bases Basic.lean's density (and its
  `ext_locallyConstant` corollary) on that lemma, deleting the ℤ_p-specific proof.
  ATTACK: T018' is stated for which domain/target? (Verified in file: domain any
  profinite `X`, target any `[NormedAddCommGroup E] [IsUltrametricDist E]`; values
  taken in the image — `R`-valued f gets `R`-valued approximants by construction.)
  SURVIVED.
- **W-r3** Mahler layer (MahlerTransform.lean): mathlib `mahlerEquiv` is already
  E-general (MahlerBasis.lean:356). Our `mahlerCoeff/mahlerTransform/ofPowerSeries`
  re-parametrise; the duality argument (coefficients of μ bounded by W-r1; for
  `F ∈ R⟦T⟧`, `ofPowerSeries F` summability from `aₙ → 0`) is coefficient-agnostic.
  ATTACK: `binomialSeries`/`Ring.choose` usage needs `BinomialRing R`? — no: the
  binomial coefficients live in ℤ_[p] and act on R through the algebra map; the §3
  proofs use `Ring.choose` on ℤ_[p] then `algebraMap`. The one genuinely
  ℤ_p-flavoured input, `𝓐(δ_n) = (1+T)^n` via `binomialSeries_nat`, maps through.
  SURVIVED (worker re-checks each `PadicInt.*` call site).
- **W-r4** Toolbox/UnitsZp/Fubini/Λ(ℤ_p^×)-ring: space-side constructions
  (pushforwards along `X`-maps, clopen indicators, `shiftDiv`, units geometry) —
  coefficient-blind; convolution/Fubini re-run by W-r2/W-r3. The pseudo-measure
  *theory* (zero-divisor lemma, augmentation ideal, Lem 3.38) is NOT widened — §5
  never needs it over R (Thm 5.7 produces a genuine measure; ζ_p stays over ℤ_p and
  is paired through base change W4). PseudoMeasure.lean is widened only in its
  Λ(ℤ_p^×)-ring section.
- **W-r5** §4 files: stay at `R := ℤ_[p]` via instantiation; no churn. ATTACK: do
  the §4 call sites elaborate once Measure/* takes an `R` parameter with ℤ_[p]
  default-instance? — the W-tickets keep `variable (R)`-explicit style with
  `abbrev`-compatibility or update §4 call sites mechanically; DoD includes
  `lake build PadicLFunctions` green project-wide.

### New leaves (skeletonised in Coefficients.lean)
- **W1** (leaf): `integerRing L : Subring L`, carrier `{x | ‖x‖ ≤ 1}` — closed under
  `+` by `IsUltrametricDist.norm_add_le_max`, under `*` by submultiplicativity; with
  `instNormedCommRing` (SubringClass), `instCompleteSpace` (closed subset),
  `instIsUltrametricDist`, `Algebra ℤ_[p] (integerRing L)` (image of the ball under
  the algebra map: `‖algebraMap ℤ_[p] L x‖ ≤ 1` — *hypothesis* on the algebra
  structure, bundled into the typeclass spelling chosen at W1).
  Source: TeX 690 "O_L its ring of integers". Mathlib check: `Valuation.integer`
  exists for `Valued`; no norm-unit-ball `Subring` for `IsUltrametricDist` fields
  found (grep 2026-06-10) — PR candidate. Attacks: [1] counterexample: closure
  under + fails without ultrametric (archimedean |1+1|>1) — hypothesis necessary ✓;
  [2] edge p=2: nothing p-specific in W1 ✓; [3] discharge: every instance named
  above verified available (SubringClass.toNormedCommRing,
  IsClosed.completeSpace_coe, ultrametric-subtype) by local search at skeleton
  time. SURVIVED.
- **W2** (leaf): `IsPrimitiveRoot.norm_sub_one_lt (hζ : IsPrimitiveRoot ζ (p^n))
  (hn : 1 ≤ n) : ‖ζ - 1‖ < 1` (in L; hence `ζ - 1` topologically nilpotent in R).
  Source: standard (RJW cites the analogous unit fact at TeX 1798 for the
  coprime case; the p-power case is classical [Washington Lem. 1.x]). Route:
  `x := ζ - 1`; `(1+x)^{p^n} = 1`; `v_p(binom(p^n, j)) = n - v_p(j) ≥ 1` for
  `0 < j < p^n` (mathlib: `Nat.Prime.pow_dvd_choose`-family / Kummer), so
  `x^{p^n} = -∑_{0<j<p^n} binom·x^j` has every RHS term of norm ≤ ‖p‖·max(1,‖x‖^j);
  if `‖x‖ ≥ 1` then taking norms gives `‖x‖^{p^n} ≤ ‖p‖·‖x‖^{p^n-1} < ‖x‖^{p^n-1}`,
  contradiction with `‖x‖ ≥ 1`. Attacks: [1] edge n=0: ζ = 1 excluded by `1 ≤ n`…
  but ζ primitive p⁰ = 1-st root IS 1, and ‖0‖ < 1 ✓ holds anyway — hypothesis
  `1 ≤ n` kept for the honest statement, noted droppable; [2] ζ = 1 (n ≥ 1,
  p^n > 1): IsPrimitiveRoot excludes ✓; [3] NormMulClass needed? — only
  submultiplicativity and `‖p‖ < 1` (from the ℤ_[p]-algebra normalisation);
  `‖p‖ < 1` must be a recorded hypothesis of the typeclass spelling — ATTACK
  SURFACED REAL CONSTRAINT: the algebra `ℤ_[p] → L` must be norm-compatible
  (‖algebraMap x‖ = ‖x‖, or at least ‖p‖_L < 1); bundled into W1's spelling.
  SURVIVED with the recorded constraint.
- **W3** (leaf): `IsPrimitiveRoot.norm_sub_one_eq_one` — for `ζ` a primitive D-th
  root, `p ∤ D`, `c` with `ζ^c ≠ 1`: `‖ζ^c - 1‖ = 1` (hence a unit of R).
  Source (verbatim, TeX 1798): "and \epsilon_D^c -1 \in \roi_L^\times (since it
  has norm dividing D)". Route: `∏_{0<j<D}(X - ζ^j) = (X^D-1)/(X-1)` at `X = 1`
  gives `∏_{0<j<D}(1 - ζ^j) = D`; norms multiply (NormMulClass), each factor has
  norm ≤ 1 (in R), and `‖D‖ = 1` since `p ∤ D` — so every factor has norm exactly 1.
  Attacks: [1] needs ζ ∈ R (‖ζ‖ ≤ 1): ζ^D = 1 + NormMulClass forces ‖ζ‖ = 1 ✓;
  [2] D = 1, 2 edges: D=1 vacuous (no c), D=2, ζ=−1, c=1: ‖−2‖: p odd ⟹ ‖2‖=1 ✓
  (p = 2 EXCLUDED where this is used? — no: this lemma is p-free except ‖D‖ = 1
  ⟸ p ∤ D ✓ fine for p = 2 with D odd; no silent p≠2 issue); [3] mathlib overlap:
  `IsPrimitiveRoot.prod_one_sub` / cyclotomic-at-one lemmas exist
  (`Polynomial.cyclotomic`-family) — discharge via `IsPrimitiveRoot.prod_pow_sub_one`
  -shaped lemma if present, else the 8-line product argument. SURVIVED.
- **W4** (leaf): scalar extension `baseChange : Λ_{ℤ_p}(X) →+* Λ_R(X)`-grade map
  (at minimum: `PadicMeasure p X → PadicMeasureR R X` with
  `baseChange μ f = ∑' n, (coeffs)` — definition via Mahler for `X = ℤ_p`
  (transform-side: the coefficientwise inclusion `ℤ_p⟦T⟧ → R⟦T⟧`) and via
  `C(X, ℤ_[p])`-density for general profinite X (extend μ R-linearly along
  locally-constant approximation). Needed by: Thm 5.1 (pairing χ·x^k against the
  ℤ_p-witnesses of ζ_p), §5.2 (comparing with §4's μ_a). Source: implicit
  throughout §5.1 ("seen as a locally constant character of Z_p^×" pairing against
  ζ_p, TeX 1620–1621). Attacks: [1] well-definedness of the density route =
  uniform continuity of μ (W-r1) ✓; [2] ring-hom on Λ(ℤ_p): transform-side
  inclusion is a ring hom of power series ✓ defeq-route; [3] compatibility
  `baseChange (dirac x) = dirac x` — definitional on transforms ✓. SURVIVED.

(Leaf-level source quotes for W: Def 3.6 TeX 755–765 — already quoted in the §3
tree — and TeX 1781, 1798 quoted above; W is a generality pass over the §3 tree,
whose per-leaf quotes remain the §3 entries'.)

### Step 1 prose (the source's own proof, TeX 1623–1765, structure-preserving)
The proof (TeX 1751–1765) composes: (a) since χ vanishes on pℤ_p,
∫_{ℤ_p^×}χx^k·μ_a = ∫_{ℤ_p}χx^k·μ_a = ∫x^k·μ_{χ,a} where μ_{χ,a} is the twist
(eq:twist by chi, TeX 1637–1640); (b) the integral is (∂^k F_{χ,a})(0)
(`cor:eval at x^k`, §3 toolbox — our `apply_powCM` route); (c) F_{χ,a} is computed
by Lem 5.4 (`lem:mahler chi`, TeX 1675–1692) whose proof decomposes χ-twist into
residue-class restrictions and applies EqRestrictionFormula plus the two Gauss-sum
properties of Rem 5.3; (d) the special value f^{(k)}_{χ,a}(0) =
−(1−χ(a)a^{k+1})L(χ,−k) is the complex Lemma 5.5 (`lem:dirichlet integral`,
TeX 1702–1740) via §2's thm:l-function — the same Mellin bridge §4 met at
`kl-values-of-zeta`; p-adically the value is the generalised-Bernoulli number, and
the §4 pattern (T030–T033: rational/algebraic value + quarantined complex bridge)
applies, with Washington Ch. 4 / DS05 §4 as the cross-reference for the
generalised-Bernoulli generating function (source-gap fallback step 1, recorded);
(e) the shift x ↦ x⁻¹-twist and θ_a-cancellation as in §4's T036/T038 give the ζ_p
statement: "∫χ(x)x^k·θ_a = −(1−χ(a)a^k)" (TeX 1760–1761) and hence the theorem.

  - Discharge: definition + `LinearMap` bookkeeping (mul action on C(X,R) ✓ §3).
  - Attacks: [1] needs C(ℤ_p,R) a ring with χ̃·f continuous ✓; [2] twist by a

    equal the source's unit-restricted sum ✓ definitional bridge lemma.
  - Attacks: [1] the AddChar-from-root construction at general N: verify name

    at a time (the system matters for compatibility across n in later sections);
    parametrising by `IsPrimitiveRoot ζ (p^n)` per-statement is faithful here;
    recorded so §8+ (Coleman) revisits. SURVIVED.

  form. For `r ∈ R` topologically nilpotent with character `κ_r` (mathlib

  - Route: coefficientwise, T009/T014 pattern: LHS_n = μ(κ_r·binom(·,n));
    κ_r = Σ_m binom(·,m) r^m (the AddChar.lean construction is literally this
    Mahler series); product-of-binomials expansion + Chu–Vandermonde regroups to
    the eval₂ coefficient. Dirac sanity: μ = δ_m ⟹ both sides z^m(1+T)^m.
  - Attacks: [1] instance stack for eval₂ (IsLinearTopology R⟦T⟧, complete, T2):
    WithPiTopology over R-with-norm-topology — R's topology linear (balls are
    ideals of R: `‖x‖ ≤ ε`-sets ✓ ultrametric+submult) — instance leaf L5.1.6a in

  - Route: measure-side orthogonality: Σ_{c} ζ^{(x−b)c} = p^n·1_{x ≡ b (p^n)}
    pointwise on ℤ_p (finite geometric sum; x ≡ b detection through toZModPow n),

    = χ(−1)p^n — in cleared bookkeeping: multiply L5.1.7's χ-summed form by
    χ(−1)G(χ⁻¹)² …; the worker follows the algebra; the trace pins the final

### Step 1 prose (source proof, TeX 1785–1875)
The source gives "only the main ideas" (TeX 1786: "the proof of Theorem
\ref{thm:nontame} is a good exercise") — per Phase 1e the gaps are expanded
here and each expansion is a leaf. Chain: (1) define F_η (EquationFeta, TeX
1793–1795) — an honest element of O_L⟦T⟧ because each (1+T)ε_D^c − 1 is a UNIT
(constant term ε_D^c − 1 ∈ O_L^×, TeX 1798's parenthetical, = W3) — and μ_η its
measure; (2) Lem 5.9 (TeX 1801–1807): ∫x^k μ_η = L(η,−k), "proved in a similar
manner to Lemma 5.5" — p-adically: the F_η Taylor coefficients give the
generalised Bernoulli values (GenBernoulli cluster, η-instance — NO clearing
needed since G(η⁻¹), D ∈ R^×); (3) Lem 5.10 ψ(F_η) = η(p)F_η (TeX 1812–1827)
via the trace identity (TeX 1818); (4) Lem 5.11 (TeX 1831–1843):
Res_{ℤ_p^×}μ_η = μ_η − η(p)φμ_η and ∫x^k φμ = p^k∫x^k μ ⟹
∫_{ℤ_p^×}x^k μ_η = (1−η(p)p^k)L(η,−k); (5) μ_θ := (μ_η)_χ, Lem 5.12 transform
formula (TeX 1849–1852) "Using Lemma 5.4, we find easily"; the χ-twisted moments
"Via a calculation essentially identical to the cases already seen" (TeX 1854–
1856) and Res-formula (TeX 1858–1861); (6) ζ_η := x⁻¹Res_{ℤ_p^×}(μ_η)
(Def, TeX 1866–1868) and the final display (TeX 1870–1873); uniqueness from
density of the twisted monomials (the source treats it as implicit in "unique
measure" — expanded as L5.2.8).

### Leaves (NonTame.lean; coefficient field L ⊇ μ_D + values of η)

  **Recorded replan (R3/T034 pattern).** The source proves this by the μ_p-trace

  of the source's own partial-fraction identity, as in R3):
  let γ_c := (ε^c δ_1 − δ_0)⁻¹ ∈ Λ_R (L5.2.1/L5.2.2), A_c := ε^{pc}δ_1 − δ_0.
  (i) geometric telescope in Λ_R:
      φ(A_c)·γ_c = Σ_{j<p} ε^{jc}δ_j   [since ((1+T)^pε^{pc}−1) =
      ((1+T)ε^c−1)·Σ_{j<p}((1+T)ε^c)^j — the cleared trace identity];
  (ii) apply ψ + projection formula (W-widened psi_phi_mul):

## §5 prior-B2 consultation (Step 4.6)
`b2_log.jsonl` checked 2026-06-10: empty (0 entries). No name or shape matches
possible. Clean.

## §5 confidence gate (Step 5) — assessment

1. Every leaf above is mathlib-discharged (cited + verified in the §5 survey
   table, plan.md), project-discharged (named §3/§4 decls + W-widening), or an
   explicit API-gap with its own sub-decomposition (W1–W4, L5.1.5, L5.1.9–10,
   L5.2.8-design, L5.3.1–3) — no "figure it out during execution" steps remain.
2. Skeleton: new-math leaves skeletonised in the 7 files listed; W-cluster per
   the recorded refactor exception. `lake build` gate checked at skeleton commit.
3. Verbatim quotes: every R5.x leaf carries one (or points at the §3-tree quote
   it generalises — W). Lean ↔ source match paragraphs inline per leaf.
4. Adversarial pass: every leaf has ≥ 3 attacks logged; FOUR attacks found real
   defects and fixed the plan at planning time (L5.1.8 statement-sign by trace;
   L5.2.6 wrong-route at level Dp^n; L5.2.8 quantifier design; W-r1 false
   circularity resolved by R-valuedness) — the pass earned its keep.
5. Prior-B2: empty log, clean.
6. Tree mirrors the source: §5.1 follows TeX 1623–1765's chain (a)–(e); §5.2
   follows TeX 1785–1875 item-by-item (each "good exercise" gap expanded as a
   leaf with the expansion recorded); §5.3 follows TeX 1885–1962. LOC estimates
   deferred to tickets, grounded per-leaf in the source-line spans cited there.

REVIEW-PENDING: none. API gaps all carry sub-decompositions. GATE PASSES for
ticket creation, with the three recorded replan/design notes (R5-CLEAR,
L5.2.4-route, L5.2.8/L5.3.3 statement designs) to surface at board approval.

## R5.E: p-adic exponential and logarithm (user-requested 2026-06-10 at board approval)

### Source statement (verbatim, TeX 1892–1897, Lem 5.14)
> "The $p$-adic exponential map converges on $p\Zp$. Hence, for any $s \in \Zp$,
> the function $1+p\Zp \rightarrow \Zp$ given by $x \mapsto x^s \defeq
> \mathrm{\exp}(s\cdot\mathrm{log}(x))$ is well-defined."
> Proof: "This is a standard result in the theory of local fields; see e.g.\
> \cite[\S12]{cassels}."

### Step 1 prose (source defers to Cassels §12; cross-reference Washington §5.1
— fallback chain step 1, recorded)
exp(x) = Σ x^n/n! converges iff v_p(x) > 1/(p−1) (Legendre: v_p(n!) =
(n − s_p(n))/(p−1)); on that ball exp is an isometry (‖exp x − exp y‖ = ‖x−y‖,
each difference-term beyond the linear one being strictly smaller
ultrametrically), hence a bijection onto 1 + ball with inverse log; exp(x+y) =
exp(x)exp(y) by the binomial/double-series rearrangement (unconditional
convergence, ultrametric). For p odd, pℤ_p is inside the ball; x^s := exp(s log x)
is then a continuous character ℤ_p → 1+pℤ_p with value x at 1, hence agrees with
`onePAdicPow` (L5.3.3) by uniqueness (`continuousAddCharEquiv`).

## R6: The values at s = 1 (RJW §6, TeX 1980–2180) — draft-1 (pre-skeleton)

### Source statements (verbatim)
- Thm 6.1 (`s=1 theorem`, TeX 1987–1995): "Let $\theta$ be a non-trivial
  Dirichlet character of conductor $N$, and let $\varepsilon_N$ denote a
  primitive $N$th root of unity. Then: (i) (Classical value at $s=1$). We have
  $L(\theta,1) = -\frac{1}{G(\theta^{-1})} \sum_{c \in (\Z/N\Z)^\times}
  \theta^{-1}(c) \log\big( 1-\varepsilon_N^c \big)$. (ii) ($p$-adic value at
  $s=1$). We have $L_p(\theta,1) = -\big( 1 - \theta(p) p^{-1} \big)
  \frac{1}{G(\theta^{-1})} \sum_{c \in (\Z/N\Z)^\times} \theta^{-1}(c)

  \sum_{c \in (\Z / N \Z)^\times} \theta^{-1}(c) \log \big( (1 + T)
  \epsilon_N^c - 1 \big)$".
- Lem 6.2 (`lem:bounded power series`, TeX 2074): "The power series
  $\widetilde{F}_\theta(T)$ is an element of $\mathscr{R}^+$." (Proof TeX
  2076–2085: the log-expansion $\log((1+T)\epsilon^c-1) =
  \log_p(\epsilon^c-1) + \sum_{n\ge1} \frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n}
  \frac{\epsilon^{cn}}{(\epsilon^c-1)^n}T^n$.)
- Lem 6.3 (`lem:mu theta'`, TeX 2090): "We have $x \widetilde{\mu}_\theta =
  \mu_\theta$. In particular, $\mathrm{Res}_{\Zp^\times}(\widetilde{\mu}_\theta)
  = x^{-1}\mathrm{Res}_{\zpe}(\mu_\theta)$." (Proof: $\partial\widetilde F =
  F_\theta$ via $\partial\log((1+T)\epsilon^c-1) = 1 +
  \frac{1}{(1+T)\epsilon^c-1}$ and $\sum_c\theta^{-1}(c) = 0$.)
- eq:Lptheta 1,2 (TeX 2113): "$L_p(\theta,1) =
  \big((1-\varphi\circ\psi)\widetilde F_\theta\big)(0)$".
- Proof of (ii), case n≥1 (TeX 2120–2126): χ kills pℤ_p so
  $\mathrm{Res}_{p\Zp}(\widetilde\mu_\theta)=0$; case n=0 (TeX 2128–2148):
  Eqphipsi ξ-sum, $\sum_{\xi\in\mu_p}\log_p(\xi\varepsilon_N^c-1) =
  \log_p(\varepsilon_N^{pc}-1)$, and the automorphism $c\mapsto pc$ giving
  $\varphi\circ\psi(\widetilde F_\theta)(0) = \frac{\theta(p)}{p}
  \widetilde F_\theta(0)$. Final step uses $\log_p(x)=\log_p(-x)$.

### Recorded replans (rule 5; user-approved route 2026-06-11 "as planned")
1. **Distribution-free route for (ii)** (plan.md §6 addendum): RJW's
   ℛ⁺/locally-analytic layer (thm:mahler la) is replaced by the ψ-kernel
   constant-pin at the formal-series level. Lem 6.2's ℛ⁺-membership is NOT
   formalised (deferred with the §3.7 cluster); Lem 6.3's content enters as
   the pair (∂F̃ = F_θ formal identity) + (𝓐_ρ = F̃ − φψF̃ by ∂-match,
   ψ-kernel, ker ∂ = constants). Thm 6.1(ii)'s STATEMENT is unchanged.
2. **ψ-evaluation instead of formal Eqphipsi.** ATTACK (succeeded, route
   fixed): the planned "Eqphipsi as a formal-series identity
   φψF = p⁻¹Σ_ξ F((1+T)ξ−1)" is ILL-FORMED in PowerSeries: the substitution
   T ↦ (1+T)ξ−1 has non-nilpotent constant term ξ−1 ≠ 0 for ξ ≠ 1, so
   `PowerSeries.subst` does not apply. Fix: the deferred Eqphipsi is
   realised as the CONVERGENT-EVALUATION identity at T = 0 only:
   `psiSeries_eval_zero : (ψF).eval 0 = p⁻¹ Σ_{ξ∈μ_p} F.eval (ξ−1)`
   (eval := ∑' coeff_n • zⁿ, the T522 helper pattern), proved by evaluating
   the digit decomposition F = Σ_{i<p}(1+T)^i·φ(F_i) at z = ξ−1 (where
   (1+z)^p−1 = 0 collapses the φ-layer) + μ_p-orthogonality Σ_ξ ξ^i = p·[i=0].
   This needs μ_p ⊂ K (the §5 hε-hypothesis pattern) and convergence only
   for our explicit log-growth coefficients.
3. **Case n ≥ 1 via primitive-fiber character sums.** RJW's support argument
   (χ|_{pℤ_p} = 0 ⟹ Res_{pℤ_p}μ̃ = 0) is replaced by: in the evaluated
   ξ-sum, Σ_{c∈(ℤ/N)ˣ} θ⁻¹(c)·extLog(ε_N^{pc}−1) regroups along the p-to-1
   map c ↦ pc whose fibers are translates by N/p; the inner sum
   Σ_{j mod p} θ⁻¹(c + jN/p) = 0 because θ is primitive of conductor N
   (does not factor through N/p). Same conclusion ((φψF̃)(0) = 0 = θ(p)·…
   since θ(p) = 0), uniform bookkeeping with case n = 0 (where c ↦ pc is an
   automorphism and the sum collapses to θ(p)·F̃(0)).
4. **Scope: D > 1.** Thm 6.1(ii) is stated for θ = χη with η primitive of
   conductor D, 1 < D, p ∤ D (the §5.2 standing hypotheses, =
   zetaEta/LpFunction stack). The pure-p-power case D = 1 (θ = χ ≠ 1) is
   DEFERRED: RJW's own §5.2 μ_η-machinery assumes D > 1, and the D = 1
   object is the χ-twist of the ζ_p pseudo-measure (a genuine measure, but
   needing its own mini-cluster). Deferred-note to plan.md "Deferred" table;
   blueprint node will carry a rationale sentence.
5. **Clearing convention.** All series-level work is G-cleared as in §5
   (muEtaCleared/T508 twist conventions). RJW's 1/G(θ⁻¹) display is
   recovered through the coprime Gauss-sum factorisation leaf (c4 below);
   the headline statement matches RJW's display in K after un-clearing by
   the unit G-factors.

### Cluster W6a — extended p-adic logarithm (new file PadicLFunctions/ExtLog.lean)
Source: statement-level RJW TeX 1992–1995 (log_p at 1−ε^c) — RJW never
construct log_p beyond Lem 5.14's ball; construction cross-ref Washington
*Cyclotomic Fields* §5.1 (Iwasawa log, ~1.5pp). Ambient: the PadicExp
variables (L complete ultrametric NormedField, NormedAlgebra ℚ_[p] L).
- a1 (leaf) `mul_mem_expBall`: y,z ∈ 1+ball ⟹ yz ∈ 1+ball (ultrametric;
  ‖yz−1‖ ≤ max(‖y−1‖‖z‖, ‖z−1‖)).
- a2 (leaf) `padicLog_pow`: padicLog(y^n) = n • padicLog y (induction on
  padicLog_mul + a1).
- a3 (leaf) `norm_pow_p_sub_one_le`: ‖w−1‖ < 1 ⟹
  ‖w^p−1‖ ≤ max(‖w−1‖^p, p⁻¹‖w−1‖) (binomial, p ∣ C(p,i) for 0<i<p).
- a4 (leaf) `exists_pPow_pow_inExpBall`: ‖w−1‖ < 1 ⟹ ∃ j,
  InExpBall p (w^(p^j) − 1) (iterate a3; ratio max(r^{p−1}, p⁻¹) < 1
  geometric. ATTACK note: at the closed boundary r = p^{-1/(p−1)} a single
  step does NOT contract (r^p = r/p exactly) but r < 1 still gives the
  strict geometric factor max(r₀^{p−1},p⁻¹) < 1 — the iteration passes
  THROUGH the boundary; verified by hand).
- a5 (leaf) `exists_pow_sub_one_norm_le` (pigeonhole): z integral over ℤ,
  ‖z‖ = 1 ⟹ ∃ m > 0, ‖z^m − 1‖ ≤ p⁻¹. Route: Algebra.adjoin ℤ {z} is
  module-finite (IsIntegral), its mod-p quotient is finite, pigeonhole gives
  z̄^i = z̄^{i+m}, i.e. z^i(z^m−1) ∈ p·(adjoin) ⊆ p·integerRing, and
  ‖z^i‖ = 1 cancels WITHOUT needing z̄ invertible (norm multiplicativity).
  ATTACK (succeeded, design fixed): the naive "z̄ unit in the finite ring"
  claim is false in general (z⁻¹ need not be integral); the norm-cancel
  formulation avoids it.
- a6 (def) `extLog` (junk-total): dite on
  ∃ m k y, 0 < m ∧ x^m = (p:L)^k * y ∧ InExpBall p (y−1), value
  (m:ℚ_[p])⁻¹ • padicLog y (choice-extracted witness).

  (well-definedness: x^{mm'} two ways ⟹ p^{km'−k'm} = y'^m y^{−m'};
  norms force km' = k'm since ‖p‖ < 1 and the y-side has norm 1;
  cancel and apply a2).
- a8 (leaf) `extLog_eq_padicLog`: InExpBall p (x−1) ⟹ extLog x = padicLog x
  (witness (1,0,x)).
- a9 (leaf) `extLog_mul`: both in domain ⟹ extLog(xy) = extLog x + extLog y
  (combine witnesses, a1, padicLog_mul, a2).
- a10 (leaf) `extLog_eq_zero_of_pow_eq_one` (roots of unity) +
  `extLog_neg` (via (−1)² = 1 and a9; needs −x ∈ domain from x ∈ domain —
  square the witness).
- a11 (leaf) `extLogDomain_of_integral_norm_one`: z integral over ℤ, ‖z‖ = 1
  ⟹ z in the extLog domain with k = 0 witness (a5 then a4; covers ALL the
  theorem's arguments 1−ε_N^c for D > 1 — their norm-1-ness is p7's c-side
  bookkeeping via the cyclotomic product Φ_D(1)).

### Gate status (Step 5) — DRAFT-1, NOT YET PASSED
Outstanding before tickets: (α) Lean skeleton (Step 2.5) for all four
files; (β) per-leaf attack blocks in the binding 3-attack format (the
design-level attacks recorded above already killed two routes — formal
Eqphipsi, pigeonhole-unit — and pinned the boundary-iteration subtlety);
(γ) survey completion: c1/c2 mathlib names (area B), b7/b1 mathlib check
(ker-∂, digit machinery), character-sum lemma names (p3, p7);
(δ) skeleton `lake build` green. Tickets (1g) only after the gate.


### R6.6 (added 2026-06-11, mid-execution replan — binding for W6b/P6)
ATTACK SUCCEEDED at T605 (B2-grade, logged in b2_log.jsonl): the digit
decomposition is FALSE over field coefficients (over ℚ, (1+T)^p − 1 has
unit linear term, so φ is bijective and digits are non-unique). It is the
p-adically INTEGRAL statement (proved over integerRing K by
measure-transport through mahlerRingEquiv). Every downstream use of ψ on
the FIELD-coefficient series F̃_θ was therefore ill-posed. REALIGNED
(the c₀-design; same mathematics, ψ-free scaffolding): with
W := (G-cleared)F̃ − 𝓐_ρ one has ∂W = φ(B) for a concrete bounded B;
choosing the formal antiderivative C (C(0) = 0, p∂C = B) gives
W = φC + c₀ with c₀ constant; evaluating at 0 and at the ξ^i − 1 (where
φ-images collapse to constant terms) yields
p·𝓐_ρ(0) = p·F̃(0) − Σ_i F̃(ξ^i−1), using sum_seriesEval_mahlerK (the
realised Eqphipsi at the INTEGRAL level) and ψρ = 0. The trace becomes
sum_seriesEval_Ftilde : Σ_i F̃(ξ^i−1) = θ(p)·F̃(0) (cases per TeX
2115–2155). Restated skeleton: FormalPsi b3' (∂φ-commutation),
exists_antideriv, b6' (integral Eqphipsi), mahlerK moved here;
ValuesAtOne p6' (mass identity), p7' (trace).

## R7: The residue of ζ_p at s = 1 (RJW §7, TeX 2181–2360) — draft

### Source statements (verbatim)
- Thm 7.1 (`thm:residue`, TeX 2187–2194): "Let $i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, p-1\}$.
  The following assertions hold: (i) If $i \neq p-1$, then $\zeta_{p,i}$ is
  analytic at $s=1$. (ii) The function $\zeta_{p,p-1}$ has a simple pole at
  $s=1$ with residue $(1 - p^{-1})$."
- Eqtmp2 (TeX 2210–2215): "$\zeta_{p,i}(s) = \frac{\int_{\Z_p^\times}
  \omega(x)^{i}\langle x\rangle^{1-s} x^{-1}\cdot\mu_a}{\omega(a)^{i}
  \langle a\rangle^{1-s} - 1}$" — definitional for `zetaPBranch` (T519).
- Lem 7.2 (`lem:g p-1`, TeX 2218–2226): "(i) If $i \neq p-1$, then
  $g_{a,i}(1) \neq 0$. … (ii) We have $g_{a,p-1}(1) = 0$, and
  $\lim_{s\to1}(s-1)^{-1}g_{a,p-1}(s) = -\log_p(a)$."
- F̃_a (TeX 2268): "$\widetilde{F}_a(T) \defeq \log\left(\frac{T}{1+T}\cdot
  \frac{(1+T)^a}{(1+T)^a-1}\right)$"; Lem 7.3 (TeX 2271): "Formally, we
  have $\partial \widetilde{F}_a(T) = F_a(T)$."
- Lem 7.4 (TeX 2285): "We have $\widetilde{F}_a(T) \in \mathscr{R}^+$."
  [SKIPPED — distribution-free route, as Lem 6.2; rationale in blueprint.]
- Lem 7.5 (`lem:numerator`, TeX 2320): "We have
  $\big((1-\varphi\circ\psi)\widetilde{F}_{a}\big)(0) = -(1-p^{-1})\log_p(a)$."
  Proof TeX 2323–2352: F̃_a(0) = −log_p(a) (the aT-factorisation
  (1+T)^a−1 = aT(1+Tg(T)), eq:poly expansion); the Eqphipsi ξ-sum with
  $\{\xi^a : \xi\in\mu_p\} = \mu_p$ (a generator) and
  $\prod_{\xi\in\mu_p}(X\xi-1) = X^p-1$, $\prod\xi^{a-1} = 1$, collapsing
  to $-p^{-1}\log_p(a)$.

### Recorded replans
1. Distribution-free route again (R6.6 verbatim): Lem 7.4 (ℛ⁺) not
   formalised; the mass ∫x⁻¹μ_a is the constant coefficient of 𝓐(ρ_a) for
   the GENUINE measure ρ_a (= the §4 `zetaNum` base-changed), pinned by
   the c₀-design and evaluated by sum_seriesEval_mahlerK.
2. "Analytic/simple pole" realised as topological statements: (i) =
   ContinuousAt (zetaPBranch p hp2 i) 1 (for 0 < i < p−1); (ii) =
   Tendsto ((s−1)·ζ_{p,p−1}(s)) (𝓝[≠]1) (𝓝 (1−p⁻¹)). RJW's
   rigid-analytic framing (Rem 4.x weight-space) stays prose.
3. The Lem 7.2 limit via the exp/log bridge (T523) instead of RJW's
   binomial-series manipulation (TeX 2236–2248): ⟨a⟩^{1−s} =
   exp((1−s)log⟨a⟩), so (s−1)⁻¹(⟨a⟩^{1−s}−1) → −log⟨a⟩ follows from the
   exp-derivative-at-0; equivalent by T523's uniqueness (the binomial
   route IS available but the exp-route reuses proven API; replan note).
4. ξ-field: statements needing μ_p ⊂ K quantify over K (the §5/§6
   pattern); the ℚ_p-level conclusions descend by algebraMap-injectivity.
   K instantiated with ℂ_[p] (mathlib PadicComplex) — survey-gated.

## R8: The p-adic family of Eisenstein series (RJW §8, TeX 2361–2446)

### Section prose (read in full 2026-06-12)

§8 closes Part I: the Kubota–Leopoldt pseudo-measure interpolates the
*constant* coefficients of the (p-stabilised) Eisenstein series; the
non-constant coefficients are interpolated by elementary divisor-sums of
Dirac measures; bundling coefficientwise gives the Λ-adic Eisenstein
family 𝐄 ∈ Q(ℤ_p^×)⟦q⟧. One Definition (p-stabilisation), one impossibility
remark (no measure interpolates p^k), one Theorem (the family + its
interpolation property). The notes' proof is 8 lines (TeX 2409–2416)
because "we've done all the work" — the §4 interpolation theorem.

### Verbatim source quotes (the four content units)

**Q1 (E_k and its expansion, TeX 2367–2373):**
> "Let k≥4 be an even integer. The Eisenstein series of level k, defined as
> G_k(z) := Σ_{(c,d)≠(0,0)} 1/(cz+d)^k […] E_k(z) := G_k(z)(k−1)!/(2·(2πi)^k)
> = ζ(1−k)/2 + Σ_{n≥1} σ_{k−1}(n)qⁿ, where σ_{k−1}(n) = Σ_{0<d|n} d^{k−1}
> and q = e^{2iπz}."

**Q2 (Dirac interpolation + impossibility, TeX 2376–2383):**
> "When d is coprime to p, we do this by viewing d as an element of ℤ_p^×
> and considering the Dirac measure δ_d at d […] ∫_{ℤ_p^×} x^k·δ_d = d^k
> for any k ∈ ℤ." / "the function k ↦ p^k can never be interpolated
> continuously p-adically […] Suppose there was indeed a measure θ_p with
> ∫_{ℤ_p^×} x^k·θ_p = p^k, and then suppose k_n is a strictly increasing
> sequence of integers p-adically tending to k. Then p^{k_n} = ∫x^{k_n}·θ_p
> ⟶ ∫x^k·θ_p = p^k, which is clearly impossible since p^{k_n} tends to 0."

**Q3 (p-stabilisation, TeX 2387–2394):**
> "We define the p-stabilisation of E_k to be E_k^{(p)}(z) := E_k(z) −
> p^{k−1}E_k(pz). An easy check shows that E_k^{(p)} = (1−p^{k−1})ζ(1−k)/2
> + Σ_{n≥1} σ^p_{k−1}(n)qⁿ, where σ^p_{k−1}(n) = Σ_{0<d|n, p∤d} d^{k−1}.
> Note E_k^{(p)} is a modular form of weight k and level Γ₀(p)."

**Q4 (the Theorem + proof, TeX 2399–2416):**
> "There exists a power series 𝐄(z) = Σ_{n≥0} A_n qⁿ ∈ Q(ℤ_p^×)⟦q⟧ such
> that: (a) A₀ is a pseudo-measure, and A_n ∈ Λ(ℤ_p^×) for all n≥1;
> (b) For all even k ≥ 4, we have ∫_{ℤ_p^×} x^{k−1}·𝐄(z) :=
> Σ_{n≥0}(∫_{ℤ_p^×}x^{k−1}·A_n)qⁿ = E_k^{(p)}(z)." / Proof: "The
> pseudo-measure A₀ is simply xζ_p/2 (shifting by 1 again, but in the
> opposite direction to before). We then define A_n = Σ_{0<d|n, p∤d} δ_d ∈
> Λ(ℤ_p^×). By the interpolation property of the Kubota–Leopoldt p-adic
> L-function, A₀ interpolates the constant term of the Eisenstein series.
> We also have ∫x^{k−1}·A_n = Σ_{0<d|n,p∤d} ∫x^{k−1}·δ_d =
> Σ_{0<d|n,p∤d} d^{k−1} = σ^p_{k−1}(n), so we get the required
> interpolation property."

### Replans (recorded; statements stay faithful)

- **R8.1 (erratum #11 — twisted pseudo-measure).** TeX 2403's "(a) A₀ is a
  pseudo-measure" is false with Def 3.34 (the pole of xζ_p is at the
  character x⁻¹; see errata.md #11 for the computation). Formalise the
  corrected claim: (g·[g]−[1])·A₀ ∈ Λ for all g, via the x-twist ring
  automorphism τ of Λ(ℤ_p^×) and its extension τ̂ to Q(ℤ_p^×);
  A₀ := τ̂(ζ_p)/2. The moment encoding mirrors `padicZeta_moments`:
  witnesses of (g·[g]−[1])·A₀ have x^{k−1}-moment
  (g^k−1)·(1−p^{k−1})·ζ(1−k)/2.
- **R8.2 (τ as a moments-checked ring hom).** τ := unitsCmul (unitsPowCM 1)
  is a ring automorphism of the convolution ring: additivity is definitional
  (unitsCmul is composition with mulLeft); multiplicativity follows from
  the zero-divisor lemma — both sides of τ(μ*ν) = τμ*τν have equal
  x^k-moments for all k > 0 by `units_mul_apply_unitsPowCM` and the shift
  τν(x^k) = ν(x^{k+1}); conclude by
  `eq_zero_of_forall_unitsPowCM_eq_zero`. No Amice/Mellin theory needed.
  Extension to Q: `IsLocalization.ringEquivOfRingEquiv` at
  M = T = nonZeroDivisors (a ring equiv maps nzd onto nzd — small lemma).
- **R8.3 (q-expansions as PowerSeries; modularity of E^{(p)} deferred).**
  The complex side states (i) the arithmetic identity σ^p_{k−1}(n) =
  σ_{k−1}(n) − p^{k−1}σ_{k−1}(n/p)·[p∣n], and (ii) the stabilised
  expansion: HasSum (fun n => c_n·q(z)ⁿ) (E_k^{RJW}(z) − p^{k−1}E_k^{RJW}(pz))
  with c₀ = (1−p^{k−1})ζ(1−k)/2, c_n = σ^p_{k−1}(n), where E_k^{RJW} :=
  (ζ(1−k)/2)•(EisensteinSeries.E) — mathlib's normalised E has constant
  term 1 (`E_qExpansion_coeff`), and RJW's E_k = ζ(1−k)/2·E. The
  Γ₀(p)-modularity of E^{(p)} (a "Note" inside the Definition, TeX 2394,
  no proof in source) is DEFERRED: mathlib has no level-raising/V_p
  operator; recorded in plan.md Deferred + blueprint node note.
- **R8.4 (𝐄 as PowerSeries over Q(ℤ_p^×)).** 𝐄 := PowerSeries.mk
  (n = 0 ↦ A₀, n ≥ 1 ↦ algebraMap (A_n)); RJW's display (b) is
  coefficientwise BY DEFINITION in the source ("∫x^{k−1}·𝐄 := Σ(∫x^{k−1}A_n)qⁿ"),
  so the theorem is exactly the per-coefficient moment statements +
  the complex identification of the target coefficients.

## R9–R10: Notation + The Coleman map (RJW §9 TeX 2466–2511, §10 TeX 2512–2948)

### Section prose (read in full 2026-06-12)

§9 is the Part-II notation index: F_n = ℚ(μ_{p^n}), the LOCAL tower
K_n = ℚ_p(μ_{p^n}), units 𝒰_n = O_{K_n}^×, principal units 𝒰_{n,1},
norm-inverse-limits 𝒰_∞, the cyclotomic character 𝒢 ≅ ℤ_p^×, and the
fixed compatible system ξ_{p^n} (ξ_{p^{n+1}}^p = ξ_{p^n}) with
π_n = ξ_{p^n} − 1 a uniformiser of K_n. Only the LOCAL tower is needed
for §10 (the global F_n/𝒱_n and the +-objects enter at §11).

§10 proves Coleman's theorem and builds the Coleman map:
- 10.1: single-level interpolation lemma + the statement (thm:coleman
  power series): a unique injective multiplicative hom 𝒰_∞ → ℤ_p⟦T⟧^×,
  u ↦ f_u, with f_u(π_n) = u_n.
- 10.2: cyclotomic units c_n(a) = (ξ^a−1)/(ξ−1), norm-compatibility,
  the explicit f_{c(a)} = ((1+T)^a−1)/T, ∂log f_{c(a)} = a − 1 − F_a
  (prop:coleman zetap), and (1−φψ)∂log f_{c(a)} = −(1−φψ)F_a
  (lem:relate cyclo to mua).
- 10.3: uniqueness (Weierstrass preparation ⟹ finitely many zeros in
  the open ball; the π_n are infinitely many), the norm operator 𝒩
  (φ∘𝒩 f = Π_{η∈μ_p} f(η(1+T)−1), defined as the B/A-algebra norm for
  B = ℤ_p⟦T⟧ ⊇ A = φ(ℤ_p⟦T⟧)), the evaluation/norm commuting square
  ((𝒩f)(π_n) = N_{n+1,n}(f(π_{n+1})), via min poly X^p − ξ_{p^n} and
  φ(f)(π_{n+1}) = f(π_n)), the mod-p^k continuity lemmas (i)–(iv) of
  lem:norm continuity, and surjectivity of R by the diagonal argument
  g_n := 𝒩^n f_{2n} + compactness of ℤ_p⟦T⟧^×. Result: the isomorphism
  𝒰_∞ ≅ (ℤ_p⟦T⟧^×)^{𝒩=id} (thm:coleman map 2).
- 10.4: Col := 𝓐⁻¹ ∘ ∂⁻¹-free composition
  u ↦ f_u ↦ ∂log f_u ↦ (1−φψ)(∂log f_u) ↦ x⁻¹-divide ↦ measure on ℤ_p^×
  and thm:coleman to kl: ζ_p = Col(c(a))/θ_a in Q(ℤ_p^×).

### Design decisions (replans R9/R10 — recorded, statements faithful)

- **R10.1 (the tower lives in ℂ_p).** K_n := ℚ_p⟮ξ_{p^n}⟯ as
  IntermediateField ℚ_p ℂ_[p], for a FIXED compatible system
  ξ : ℕ → ℂ_[p] (ξ_{n+1}^p = ξ_n, ξ_n primitive p^n-th; existence by
  ℕ-recursion + IsAlgClosed roots). This matches the source's own
  motivation (TeX 2528–2532 frames everything inside B(0,1) ⊂ ℂ_p),
  gives K_n ≤ K_{n+1} with honest mathlib `Algebra.norm`, and reuses
  the §7/§8 PadicComplex + seriesEval infrastructure. O_n := the
  norm-unit-ball of K_n (= integerRing ℂ_[p] ∩ K_n); 𝒰_n := O_nˣ.
- **R10.2 (degree ladder via Eisenstein).** [K_n : ℚ_p] = φ(p^n) from
  irreducibility of Φ_{p^n} over ℚ_p: Eisenstein at (p) after T ↦ T+1
  (mathlib `cyclotomic_prime_pow_comp_X_add_one_isEisensteinAt`-family
  — survey: generic Eisenstein machinery READY, the ℚ_p-instantiation
  is project work) + Gauss-primitivity over the DVR ℤ_[p]. Tower step
  [K_{n+1} : K_n] = p and minpoly_{K_n}(ξ_{n+1}) = X^p − ξ_n.
  ‖π_n‖ = p^{−1/φ(p^n)} via ‖N_{K_n/ℚ_p}(π_n)‖ = ‖±p‖ and
  Galois-invariance of the (unique, spectral) norm.
- **R10.3 (evaluation = seriesEval).** f(π_n) := seriesEval (map f) π_n
  over K := ℂ_[p] (‖π_n‖ < 1, integral coefficients ⟹ convergent; the
  §8 `seriesEval_pow`/`seriesEval_mul` layer gives multiplicativity);
  the value lies in K_n (closed: finite-dim ⟹ complete ⟹ closed;
  partial sums in ℤ_p[ξ_n]). Mathlib's new `PowerSeries.eval₂`
  (Evaluation.lean) is the recorded alternative if the normed route
  rubs; we prefer seriesEval for continuity with §§6–8.
- **R10.4 (𝒩 via the digit basis, no field-norm theory).** The source
  defines 𝒩 = φ⁻¹∘N_{B/A} for B = ℤ_p⟦T⟧ ⊇ A = φ(ℤ_p⟦T⟧). The
  μ_p-product formula is NOT formal over ℤ_p (the T ↦ η(1+T)−1
  substitution has non-nilpotent constant term — the §6 Eqphipsi
  subtlety, errata-adjacent). Faithful realisation: B is FREE of rank p
  over A with basis (1+T)^i, i < p — this is EXACTLY the proven
  integral digit decomposition (FormalPsi, T605 layer) — so define
  𝒩 f := φ⁻¹ (Algebra.norm along the φ-algebra structure) =
  φ⁻¹(det of multiplication-by-f in the digit basis). Multiplicativity
  is `Algebra.norm`'s; the commuting square (Q4) follows by mapping the
  multiplication matrix entrywise under f ↦ f(π_{n+1}) (which carries
  A-entries to O_n via φf(π_{n+1}) = f(π_n)) and `RingHom.map_det`,
  against the O_n-basis (ξ_{n+1}^i)_{i<p} of O_{n+1} (monogenic by the
  Eisenstein tower step). The trace identity ψ = p⁻¹φ⁻¹∘Tr (TeX 2670)
  becomes a digit-trace computation against the SAME basis.
- **R10.5 (continuity lemmas at the digit level).** Q5(i): φ is
  coefficientwise-injective mod p^k (digit-extraction). Q5(ii)/(iii):
  the source's proofs run mod 𝔭₁ in O_1⟦T⟧ via the product formula;
  our route: the det-formula mod p — over 𝔽_p, φ̄(f) = f(T^p)-Frobenius
  and the digit matrix of f becomes... realised as: 𝒩f ≡ f mod p ⟺
  det ≡ φ(f)-related congruence; ATTACK at execution — fallback route
  recorded: prove (ii)/(iii) via the EVALUATED form over O₁⟦T⟧ with the
  (π₁)-adic evaluation API (mathlib eval₂ at topologically nilpotent
  η(1+T)−1 — legal there) and descend by φ-injectivity (i). The
  surjectivity argument (Q6) needs only (iii)+(iv) and compactness.
- **R10.6 (compactness of ℤ_p⟦T⟧^×).** Via the coefficientwise
  homeomorphism PowerSeries ℤ_[p] ≃ (ℕ → ℤ_[p]) (Pi topology — mathlib
  WithPiTopology) + Tychonoff; the unit group as a closed subset
  (constant coeff a unit: clopen condition). Convergent-subsequence
  extraction: sequential compactness from compact + metrizable?? —
  ℕ → ℤ_[p] with product topology IS metrizable (countable product) ✓
  `IsCompact.isSeqCompact`-route.
- **R10.7 (scope).** §10.5 (Kummer/Euler systems/Perrin-Riou):
  prose-only, deferred — blueprint chapter text covers it; no Lean.
  §9's global objects (F_n, 𝒱_n, +-subfields, 𝒢-Galois): deferred to
  the §11 pass (only the local tower is §10-load-bearing); the
  cyclotomic character iso 𝒢 ≅ ℤ_p^× rides §11.
- **R10.8 (θ_a and the final identity).** thm:coleman to kl: both sides
  are pseudo-measures with ([a]−[1])-witnesses; the witness of the
  RHS is Col(c(a)) itself against θ_a := [a]−... (RJW's θ_a from §4 —
  our `dirac p u − 1`-denominator); the proof is moment-comparison:
  Col(c(a))'s moments = (1−φψ)∂log f_{c(a)}-coefficients = −(1−φψ)F_a
  data (Q7's lem:relate cyclo to mua) = ([a]−[1])ζ_p's moments
  (zetaNum), then `pseudoMeasure_eq_zero_of_moments`-uniqueness — all
  §3.6/§4 infrastructure.

### Gate status: draft-approved shape — skeleton + per-leaf attacks at
execution (the established per-ticket pattern). Survey anchors
(Explore agent, 2026-06-12): IsCyclotomicExtension API READY;
Eisenstein machinery READY (ℚ_p-instantiation = project leaf);
Algebra.norm + autEquivPow READY; PowerSeries.eval₂ (Evaluation.lean,
2024) READY; Weierstrass preparation (WeierstrassPreparation.lean,
2025) READY; Pi-topology READY (CompactSpace instance = small project
leaf); inverse limits = ad-hoc subtype (standard). MISSING/project:
Φ_{p^n}-irreducibility over ℚ_p, O_n-monogenicity, the 𝒩-cluster,
norm-compatible towers.

## D61: Thm 6.1(ii) at D = 1 (the deferred §6 debt — errata #6) — planning
pass 2026-06-12 (T-D61; survey: the Explore agent's feasibility report)

### The gap (recap)
RJW Thm 6.1(ii) is stated for all non-trivial θ = χη but proved through
μ_η, which at D = 1 is junk (`muEtaCleared`'s denominators degenerate to
`Ring.inverse X` = 0; `isUnit_root_mul_one_add_X_sub_one` needs ¬D∣c,
false at D = 1, c = 0). Every §5/§6 moment theorem in the chain carries
1 < D (survey table: muEtaCleared_moments, psi/res/twist variants,
zetaEta_twisted_moments, Lp_interpolation, LpFunction_one).

### Route A (selected — survey-recommended, most economical)
Pair χ (conductor p^m, m ≥ 1, χ ≠ 1) DIRECTLY against the pseudo-measure
ζ_p via its ([b]−1)-witnesses — D-independent machinery throughout:
`padicZeta`/`padicZeta_isPseudoMeasure`/`padicZeta_moments` (ZetaP),
the §5 p-power twist layer (Twist.lean `twist_res_units` etc.,
TameConductor's no-D-hypothesis `twist_muA_moments`), mathlib p^n-level
Gauss sums (`gaussSum_mul_gaussSum_inv`). The χ-twisted-pseudo-measure
generalisation of §8's unitsTwist (Route C) is NOT needed; fixing
muEtaCleared at D = 1 (Route B) is more invasive. Expected new-lemma
count: 2–3 + the value theorem.

### D61 sub-board shape (gated tickets D611–D613 appended to tickets.md)
- D611: `padicZeta_charTwist_moments` — the witness-encoded twisted
  moments ∫χ(x)x^k·ζ_p = (b-factor)·(1 − χ(p)p^{k−1})·L(χ,−k)-data, by
  transporting padicZeta_moments through the χ-twist of the witness
  (the §5 twist-of-measure layer at the ℤ_p-units level) — the D = 1
  analogue of zetaEta_twisted_moments.
- D612: the D = 1 L_p-object aligner: `LpFunctionWild` (or extend
  LpFunction's junk at D = 1 with an honest definition note): the pairing
  (χ-twisted ζ_p-witness)-normalised by G(χ⁻¹) at p^m-level (Gauss-unit:
  the p-power-level analogue of gaussSum_isUnit — survey Q4: mathlib
  handles G(χ)G(χ⁻¹) = ±p^m natively; unit-ness of G in K needs χ
  primitive — small lemma).
- D613 (the value): `LpFunctionWild_one`: L_p(χ,1) =
  −(1−χ(p)p⁻¹)·G(χ⁻¹)⁻¹·Σ_c χ⁻¹(c)·extLog(1−ε^c) — the §6 c₀-design
  verbatim at N = p^m (no tame clearing): F̃_χ := the p^m-level
  logSeriesAt-sum (the T612 layer is N-generic — verify the [NeZero N]
  + 1 < N hypotheses: 1 < p^m ✓ m ≥ 1!! — NOTE: much of the §6 chain's
  "1 < N" is SATISFIED at N = p^m even though "1 < D" fails: the
  load-bearing distinction is tame-vs-wild, and the survey's hD1-table
  conflates two different hypotheses: AT EXECUTION re-check which §6
  lemmas need 1 < D (the μ_η-side, unusable) vs 1 < N (fine at p^m):
  Ftilde/sum_seriesEval_Ftilde/p_mul_constantCoeff_mahlerK_rhoTheta are
  stated over θ at level N = D·p^n — their D = 1 instantiations may be
  CLOSER to working than the survey's table suggests; the genuinely
  D > 1 pieces are the μ_η/rhoTheta-side constructions, to be replaced by
  the D611-witness route).
GATE: the D61 sub-board is 1i-GATED (user review) per T-D61's charter —
tickets carry "GATED" status; not beastmode-dispatchable until released.

## R11: Iwasawa's theorem on the zeros — the §11 layer (RJW §11, TeX 2949–3112)

### Section prose (read in full 2026-06-12)

§11 reformulates ζ_p on the Galois side and sets up Iwasawa's theorem.
11.1 (TeX 2964–3042): the identification Λ(𝒢) = Λ(ℤ_p^×) via χ (the
notes' own definitional move); the ±-decomposition by the idempotents
(1±c)/2 (p odd); Λ(𝒢)⁺ ≅ Λ(𝒢⁺) for 𝒢⁺ = 𝒢/⟨c⟩ ↔ ℤ_p^×/{±1}; the
odd-moment membership criterion; corollary: ζ_p is a pseudo-measure on
𝒢⁺. 11.2 (TeX 3043–3059): I(𝒢)ζ_p and I(𝒢⁺)ζ_p are ideals. 11.3
(TeX 3060–3112): 𝒟_n (global cyclotomic units), the class-number
index theorem (cited to Washington Thm 8.2, NOT proven in the notes),
the local closures 𝒞_n/𝒞_{n,1}/𝒞_{∞,1} (+ ⁺), and the STATEMENT of
thm:iwasawa (proof = §12). The §9 notation that comes due here
(TeX 2470–2505): 𝒰_n, 𝒰_{n,1} with its ℤ_p-structure, 𝒰_{∞,1}, the
global F_n/𝒱_n and the ⁺-subfields.

### Verbatim source quotes

**Q1 (the identification, TeX 2970):**
> "the cyclotomic character gives an isomorphism χ : 𝒢 ≅ ℤ_p^×. This
> isomorphism induces an identification between measures on ℤ_p^× and
> measures on the Galois group 𝒢. From now on, we will let Λ(𝒢) be the
> space of measures on 𝒢, which we identify with Λ(ℤ_p^×) via the
> cyclotomic character. We may thus naturally consider ζ_p as a
> pseudo-measure on 𝒢."

**Q2 (𝒢⁺ and the observation, TeX 2992):**
> "the Galois group 𝒢⁺ = Gal(F_∞⁺/ℚ) = 𝒢/⟨c⟩ is identified through the
> cyclotomic character with ℤ_p^×/{±1}. Observe that ζ_p, which
> ostensibly is an element of Q(𝒢), vanishes at the characters χ^k,
> for any odd integer k > 1. We will use this fact to show that ζ_p
> actually descends to a pseudo-measure on 𝒢⁺."

**Q3 (lem:decompose plus minus, TeX 2994–3002):**
> "Let c ∈ 𝒢 denote complex conjugation. Let R be a ring in which 2 is
> invertible and M an R-module with a continuous action of 𝒢. Then M
> decomposes as M ≅ M⁺ ⊕ M⁻, where c acts as +1 on M⁺ and as −1 on
> M⁻." Proof: "This follows directly by using the idempotents (1+c)/2
> and (1−c)/2, which act as projectors to the corresponding M⁺ and M⁻."

**Q4 (the plus-iso, TeX 3006–3015):**
> "There is a natural isomorphism Λ(𝒢)⁺ ≅ Λ(𝒢⁺)." Proof: "We work at
> finite level. Let 𝒢_n := Gal(F_n/ℚ), and 𝒢_n⁺ := Gal(F_n⁺/ℚ). Then
> there is a natural surjection ℤ_p[𝒢_n] → ℤ_p[𝒢_n⁺] … Since this must
> necessarily map ℤ_p[𝒢_n]⁻ to 0, this induces a map ℤ_p[𝒢_n]⁺ →
> ℤ_p[𝒢_n⁺]. The result now follows at finite level by a dimension
> count (as both are free ℤ_p-modules of rank (p−1)p^{n−1}/2 …). We
> obtain the required result by passing to the inverse limit." And
> TeX 3017: "We henceforth freely identify Λ(𝒢⁺) with the submodule
> Λ(𝒢)⁺ of Λ(𝒢)."

**Q5 (the criterion, TeX 3019–3029):**
> "Let μ ∈ Λ(𝒢). Then μ ∈ Λ(𝒢⁺) if and only if ∫_𝒢 χ(x)^k·μ = 0 for
> all odd k ≥ 1." Proof: "we can write μ = μ⁺ + μ⁻, where
> μ± = (1±c)/2·μ … Since χ(c) = −1 … If k is odd, the above expression
> vanishes … the same argument shows that ∫χ(x)^k·μ⁻ vanishes for all
> k even. The result follows then by Lemma lem:zero divisor."

**Q6 (the corollary, TeX 3033–3039):**
> "The p-adic zeta function is a pseudo-measure on 𝒢⁺." Proof: "This
> follows from the interpolation property, as ζ(1−k) = 0 for odd
> k ≥ 1." [ERRATUM #13: false at k = 1 (ζ(0) = −1/2); the interpolated
> moment vanishes there via the Euler factor 1−p^{1−1} = 0. Recorded
> in errata.md with the corrected two-case argument.]

**Q7 (the ideal, TeX 3047–3057):**
> "By definition of pseudo-measures, the elements ([g]−[1])ζ_p belong
> to the Iwasawa algebra Λ(𝒢) for any g ∈ 𝒢. Recall from Definition
> DefAugmentationIdealFiniteLevel that I(𝒢) denotes the augmentation
> ideal … I(𝒢) = ker(Λ(𝒢) → ℤ_p)." Proposition: "The module I(𝒢)ζ_p
> is an ideal in Λ(𝒢). Similarly, the module I(𝒢⁺)ζ_p is an ideal in
> Λ(𝒢⁺)." Proof: "Since ζ_p is a pseudo-measure, we know
> ([g]−[1])ζ_p ∈ Λ(𝒢) for all g ∈ 𝒢. Hence the result follows as
> I(𝒢) is the topological ideal generated by the elements [g]−[1] for
> g ∈ 𝒢."

**Q8 (global cyclotomic units, TeX 3065–3067):**
> "For n ≥ 1, we define the group 𝒟_n of cyclotomic units of F_n to be
> the intersection of 𝒪_{F_n}^× and the multiplicative subgroup of
> F_n^× generated by {±ξ_{p^n}, ξ_{p^n}^a − 1 : 1 ≤ a ≤ p^n − 1}. We
> set 𝒟_n⁺ = 𝒟_n ∩ F_n⁺."

**Q9 (class numbers, TeX 3072–3081 — DEFERRED PROSE):**
> "The group 𝒟_n (resp. 𝒟_n⁺) is of finite index in the group of
> units 𝒱_n (resp. 𝒱_n⁺) … h_n⁺ = [𝒱_n : 𝒟_n] = [𝒱_n⁺ : 𝒟_n⁺]."
> Proof: "We will not prove this here; see [Washington, Theorem 8.2]."
> → not formalised (the notes don't prove it); blueprint node stays
> prose; deferred-table entry in plan.md. Survey addendum (2026-06-13,
> user directive): flt-regular-bernoulli's CyclotomicUnits/Sinnott stack
> has a prime-conductor, p-primary, conditional (named unproven analytic
> core) form `p ∣ [𝒱⁺:𝒟⁺] ↔ p ∣ h⁺` — not a Q9 discharge; recorded in
> plan.md as a candidate §13 external dependency (Vandiver shape).

**Q10 (local closures, TeX 3084 + 3090–3094):**
> "The cyclotomic units c_n(a), introduced in §10.2, are naturally
> elements of 𝒟_n, hence global." / "define 𝒞_n as the p-adic closure
> of 𝒟_n inside the local units 𝒰_n, let 𝒞_n⁺ := 𝒞_n ∩ 𝒰_n⁺, and let
> 𝒞_{n,1} := 𝒞_n ∩ 𝒰_{n,1}, 𝒞⁺_{n,1} := 𝒞_n⁺ ∩ 𝒰_{n,1};
> 𝒞_{∞,1} := lim←_{n≥1} 𝒞_{n,1}, 𝒞⁺_{∞,1} := lim←_{n≥1} 𝒞⁺_{n,1}."

**Q11 (thm:iwasawa, TeX 3098–3103 — STATEMENT ONLY, §12 board):**
> "The Coleman map induces an isomorphism of Λ(𝒢⁺)-modules
> 𝒰⁺_{∞,1}/𝒞⁺_{∞,1} ≅ Λ(𝒢⁺)/I(𝒢⁺)ζ_p." → needs the Λ(𝒢⁺)-module
> structures the notes construct in §12.1–12.2 ("We will see that…",
> TeX 3096); statement + proof land on the §12 board.

**Q12 (§9 notation due now, TeX 2494–2505):**
> "𝒰_{n,1} := {u ∈ 𝒰_n : u ≡ 1 (mod 𝔭_n)}, 𝒰⁺_{n,1} := 𝒰_{n,1} ∩

### Replans (recorded; statements stay faithful)

- **R11.1 (identified Galois side).** All §11 measure statements are
  formalised on Λ(ℤ_p^×) with c := (−1 : ℤ_[p]ˣ) and
  𝒢⁺ := ℤ_[p]ˣ ⧸ zpowers(−1) — Q1 is the notes' OWN definitional move
  ("From now on, we will let Λ(𝒢) be … which we identify with
  Λ(ℤ_p^×)"), so this is not a deviation but the notes' convention.
  The genuine Galois groups: local finite level → §12 (equivariance),
  global Krull → §13/when forced. Blueprint nodes carry a prose note.
- **R11.2 (functional plus-iso).** Q4's finite-level rank-count proof
  needs the Prop 3.9/3.10 projlim presentation (still deferred — its
  §11 entry in plan.md's deferral table now points at §12). Our proof:
  π_* := pushforward along mk is a surjective ring hom; the even-part
  section σν := ν ∘ (descend ∘ (f ↦ ½(f + f∘τ))) (τ = translation by
  −1) lands in Λ⁺ and inverts π_* there; injectivity on Λ⁺ since a
  c-invariant μ satisfies μ(f) = μ(evenPart f) and even functions
  descend. Same objects, same map as Q4 (the natural surjection),
  different proof of bijectivity. Attacks attempted: (1) does σν
  really land in Λ⁺? evenPart(f∘τ) = evenPart f since τ² = id ✓;
  (2) is π_* multiplicative? mk is a continuous MonoidHom and
  convolution pushes forward along monoid homs (general lemma, proven
  via innerInt curry computation) ✓; (3) does descending need T2 or
  total disconnectedness? No — only IsQuotientMap mk (mathlib
  instance) and invariance ✓.
- **R11.3 (pseudo-measure moments = witness encoding).** Q2/Q5/Q6
  integrate pseudo-measures via the notes' eq:integrate
  pseudo-measure convention; our established encoding (padicZeta_moments
  pattern, §4) is exactly that convention. Continuation, not new.
- **R11.4 (principality replaces "topological ideal").** Q7's proof
  line "I(𝒢) is the topological ideal generated by [g]−[1]" is
  replaced by the STRONGER already-proven algebraic principality
  `augmentationIdeal_eq_span` (RJW's own Lem 3.38 machinery). I(𝒢)ζ_p
  is defined as the carrier ideal {x | ∃ l ∈ I(𝒢), x = l·ζ_p in Q}
  (ideal axioms direct from the pseudo-measure property) with
  `zetaIdeal_eq_span : zetaIdeal = Ideal.span {ν}` for any
  generator-witness pair as the computational form. Attack: is the
  carrier really smul-closed without principality? Yes — r·x ↔ l' :=
  r·l ∈ I ✓ (ideals are smul-closed); principality only enters
  eq_span. 𝒢⁺-side identical after transport.
- **R11.5 (convolution algebra generalised in place).** The
  `CommRing (PadicMeasure p ℤ_[p]ˣ)` instance, `deg`, and
  `augmentationIdeal` generalise to `[CommMonoid G] [ContinuousMul G]
  [CompactSpace G]` — `innerInt`/`integral_swap` are already general,
  the instance proofs use only monoid axioms. This is RJW Rem 3.33's
  own generality and avoids an instance diamond for Λ(𝒢⁺).
  Statement-preservation contract: every existing downstream name
  keeps its exact statement; full `lake build` gates the ticket.
  Attack: do downstream `rfl`/`change` proofs survive? The general
  instance's mul at G = ℤ_[p]ˣ is the same formula (unitsConv becomes
  an abbrev/special case); in-file proofs are updated within the
  ticket; out-of-file uses go through the preserved lemma names.
- **R11.6 (𝒰_{n,1} concretely).** "u ≡ 1 mod 𝔭_n" is rendered as
  ‖u − 1‖ < 1 (equivalent: 𝔭_n is the open unit ball of the unit-ball
  ring O_n). The ℤ_p-power u^a is mathlib's
  `addChar_of_value_at_one (u−1)` (the SAME binomial series as Q12 —
  `Tendsto ((u−1)^·) atTop (𝓝 0)` from ‖u−1‖ < 1). Module ℤ_[p]
  packaged on `Additive` of the subgroup.
- **R11.7 (towers inside ℂ_p, global objects too).** Continuation of
  R10.1: F_n := ℚ⟮ξ_n⟯, F_n⁺ := ℚ⟮ξ_n + ξ_n⁻¹⟯ as IntermediateField
  ℚ ℂ_[p] (the "+" = fixed points of conjugation is rendered by the
  standard concrete generator ξ + ξ⁻¹; the Galois-fixed-field
  characterisation is §12 material if needed); 𝒱_n := units u with
  u, u⁻¹ integral over ℤ and u ∈ F_n; 𝒟_n := Subgroup.closure
  {±ξ_n} ∪ {ξ_n^a − 1} ⊓ 𝒱_n (Q8 verbatim — the closure inside F_n^×
  is automatic since all generators lie in F_n); 𝒞_n :=
  topologicalClosure 𝒟_n ⊓ 𝒰_n (the "p-adic closure inside 𝒰_n";
  𝒰_n is closed in ℂ_[p]ˣ so this IS the subspace closure — small
  lemma; the explicit description footnote = lem:closure is §12).
  𝒰_{∞,1}/𝒞_{∞,1} as subgroups of the group-ified NormCompatUnits
  (compat imposed for n ≥ 1 per Q12's "limits n ≥ 1" — matches the
  existing structure's design). Attack on 𝒟_n ⊆ 𝒰_n: needs
  ‖u‖ ≤ 1 for u integral over ℤ — the direct ultrametric argument on
  any monic ℤ-relation (new small lemma; mathlib's spectralNorm route
  exists but is heavier); attack on ξ^a − 1 as a unit of ℂ_[p]ˣ:
  nonzero since ξ^a ≠ 1 requires p ∤ a OR a < p^n with ξ^a ≠ 1 — for
  1 ≤ a ≤ p^n − 1, ξ^a ≠ 1 since ξ has exact order p^n ✓ (Units.mk0).
- **R11.8 (what is NOT here).** thm:iwasawa (Q11) and the
  class-number theorem (Q9): statements not in this board's skeleton
  (see plan.md Scope decision). 𝒰_{∞,1}'s Λ(𝒢)-module structure: §12.

### Leaf ledger (cluster → leaves → discharge)

- **A (±-splitting).** A1 general involution splitting (NOT in
  mathlib — checked LinearAlgebra/Projection + grep "involut";
  PR candidate; proof: e := ½(1+σ) idempotent, IsCompl via
  isCompl_of_proj or direct 4-line argument). A2 instantiation:

### Per-leaf provability check
Every leaf above is discharged from: existing project API (named
above per leaf), mathlib declarations verified this session at
file:line (QuotientGroup/Quotient.lean:36 CompactSpace, :151
IsTopologicalGroup, :40/:55 quotient-map lemmas; Bernoulli.lean:217;
Padics/AddChar.lean:59; LinearAlgebra/Projection.lean idempotent API),
or new self-contained lemmas with complete arguments sketched (A1,
norm_le_one_of_isIntegral, the F7 integrality tricks). No leaf
depends on deferred machinery (Prop 3.9/3.10 NOT used anywhere).

### Confidence gate (Step 5)
(1) Every headline §11 statement is either decomposed to discharged
leaves (Q1–Q8, Q10, Q12) or explicitly deferred with a recorded reason
(Q9 prose-permanent, Q11 → §12). (2) The two genuinely new
infrastructure pieces (T1101 generalisation; A1 splitting) have
complete proofs sketched against verified API. (3) The erratum (#13)
is recorded with the corrected argument formalised as D0/D1. PASS.

## R12: Proof of Iwasawa's theorem — the §12 layer (RJW §12, TeX 3113–3616)

### Section prose (read in full 2026-06-13)
§12 proves thm:iwasawa via: (12.1) a Λ(𝒢)-module structure on 𝒰_{∞,1} +
Col equivariance; (12.2) the fundamental exact sequence (kernel/cokernel of
Col), resting on thm:log der (CCW surjectivity of ∂log) and lem:rest zp*;
(12.3/12.4) cyclic generators of the global 𝒟_n^+ and local 𝒞_{∞,1}^+
modules; (12.5) assembly into thm:iwasawa 2. The two large new
sub-developments are the Galois action on the tower (E12.1, the linchpin —
absent from both project and mathlib at the concrete-tower level) and
thm:log der (E12.2, Coleman–Coates–Wiles, the hardest mathematics in Part II).

**Q1 (ℤ_p-equivariance, TeX 3130–3135):**
> "The map Col restricts to a ℤ_p-equivariant map Col : 𝒰_{∞,1} ⟶ Λ(ℤ_p^×)."
Proof key (3137–3145): "a₀(u) ≡ 1 (mod p) … Thus f_u(T) − 1 ∈ (p,T). As

### Cluster decomposition (mirrors the source's subsection structure)

**E12.1 — Galois action on the tower (GaloisAction.lean) [LINCHPIN, gating].**
Source 3182–3236. Leaves: (a) τ_{a,n} : K_n ≃ₐ[ℚ_p] K_n via
`IsCyclotomicExtension.autEquivPow` (Tower's `isCyclotomicExtension_K` enables
it) at unitsToZModPow a; (b) `autToPow_spec`: τ_{a,n}(ξ_n) = ξ_n^{(a mod p^n)};
(c) tower-compat τ_{a,n+1}|_{K_n} = τ_{a,n} (uniqueness of the auto fixing the
char value); (d) levelNorm∘τ = τ∘levelNorm (Galois-invariance of the relative
norm: mathlib `Algebra.norm_eq_prod_automorphisms`-style / conjugation); (e) the
induced `galAction : ℤ_[p]ˣ → NormCompatUnits ≃ NormCompatUnits` (apply τ
levelwise; mem/inv_mem/compat by (d)); (f) σ_a on PowerSeries: f ↦ f((1+T)^a−1)
(`PowerSeries.subst`; HasSubst since (1+T)^a−1 has const term 0 for a ≥ 1, and
zpPow-binomial for a : ℤ_p); (g) f_{σ_a u} = σ_a f_u (interpolation
τ_{a,n}(u_n) = (σ_a f_u)(π_n) + coleman_existsUnique uniqueness). Attacks: p=2
excluded (autEquivPow needs Φ_{p^n} irreducible /ℚ_p, p odd — hp2);
edge a ∈ μ_{p−1} (σ_a fixes the tower base); the survey's "local field needs
global reduction" caveat — attack: `isCyclotomicExtension_K` is already proven
in Tower.lean so autEquivPow applies directly over ℚ_[p], no reduction needed
(VERIFY at execution; fallback = number-field reduction sub-cluster).

**E12.2 — thm:log der / CCW surjectivity (LogDerivative.lean) [HARD].**
Source 3264–3379. Leaves: series ψ=id/ψ=0 subspaces (new Submodule defs +
the `psiSeries` from NormOperator); `delPhi : Δ∘φ = p·φ∘Δ` (new power-series
identity, direct coeff calc); seriesEqphipsi (φ∘𝒩 f = ∏_{η∈μ_p} f((1+T)η−1)
at series level — the §10-deferred Eqphipsi over ℂ_p[μ_p], product collapse via
∏(Xη−1)=X^p−1); lem:log der 1 (Δ𝒲 ⊆ ψ=id, via the two above + φ injective);
lem:A mod p (𝒲 mod p = 𝔽_p⟦T⟧^×, via normOp_iterate_modEq (ii)(iv) — but those
are PARTLY ABSENT per survey: only phi_injective_mod present, so (ii)
normOp_modEq_self + (iv) iterate are SUB-LEAVES here); lem:B mod p 2 (the
𝔽_p⟦T⟧ construction — its own sub-tree, the expected Tier-A spawn); lem:B mod p;
lem:log der red mod p (A=B ⟹ onto, successive approx + ℤ_p⟦T⟧^× compactness
from §10); thm:log der assembly. Attacks: the ψ=id image needs φ injective on
ℤ_p⟦T⟧ (`phiHom` injective — coeff-degree argument); lem:B mod p 2's induction
termination (T^{m−1}-filtration is exhausting); d_n = d_{np} invariant.

**E12.3 — Fundamental exact sequence (FundamentalSequence.lean).**
Source 3382–3441. Leaves: lem:rest zp* (Σφ^n convergence in (p,T)-topology +
ker(1−φ)=constants + ψ(1+T)=0 + eval-at-0 onto); `ZpOne : Submodule …`
(ℤ_p(1) = {(ξ_n^a)_n : a ∈ ℤ_p} ⊂ 𝒰_∞, via zpPow on ξ — the kernel-of-1−φ
pullback); thm:fund exact seq (compose the four maps' kernels/cokernels:
Col iso ∘ Δ(ker μ_{p−1}, onto by E12.2) ∘ (1−φ)(ker ℤ_p, coker ℤ_p by rest zp*)
∘ ∂⁻¹ iso ∘ 𝓐⁻¹ iso); the Λ(𝒢)-module exactness (E12.1 gives equivariance,
last map ∫χ·μ equivariant). Depends on E12.1, E12.2.

**E12.4 — Generators (Generators.lean).**
Source 3450–3578. Leaves: γ_{n,a} def (half-power ξ^{(1−a)/2} via (2:ZMod p^n)⁻¹,
p odd) + γ ∈ 𝒟_n^+ (c-fixed); lem:cyc units gen (valuation argument Σe_a = 0 +
the ξ^{bp^m}−1 product identity); cor:cyc units gen 2 (a generates ⟹ telescoping
γ_{n,b} = ∏ γ_{n,a}^{σ_a^i} — needs the finite 𝒢_n^+-action from E12.1);
lem:closure (p-adic closure = ℤ_p-span: zpPow binomial convergence + ℤ_p^r
compactness); lem:global generators 2 (wγ_{n,a} ∈ 𝒰_{n,1}: γ_{n,a} ≡ a mod 𝔭_n
from f_{c(a)}(0)=a; (wγ)^{p−1} generates (p−1)𝒟_n^+); LemmaGeneratorCinfty1
(cyclic ℤ_p[𝒢_n^+]/Λ(𝒢^+) generation, (p−1) invertible). Depends on E12.1
(finite Galois action). This cluster NATIVELY resolves the §11 b2-logged
a≡1-mod-p note: w is the Teichmüller correction making wγ_{n,a} ≡ 1 mod 𝔭_n.

**E12.5 — End of proof / thm:iwasawa 2 (Main.lean) [MILESTONE].**
Source 3582–3608. Leaves: thm:iwasawa 2 (i) (the fund exact seq mod 𝒞_{∞,1},
image = I(𝒢)ζ_p by Col_cyclo/coleman_to_kl at the generators + LemmaGenerator-
Cinfty1) + (ii) (the +-part: ⟨c⟩-invariants exact since p odd, ℤ_p(1)^{⟨c⟩}=0);
wire §11's thm:iwasawa node to this. Depends on E12.3, E12.4 + the §11
zetaIdeal(Plus), Col_cyclo, coleman_to_kl.

### Source-structure mirror check (Step 6 gate)
Each cluster cites the source subsection it formalises (E12.1↔§12.1 Galois,
E12.2↔§12.2.1, E12.3↔§12.2.2, E12.4↔§12.3+12.4, E12.5↔§12.5). Internal nodes
(thm:log der, thm:fund exact seq, LemmaGeneratorCinfty1, thm:iwasawa 2) each
decompose along the source's OWN sub-lemmas (named with TeX line numbers above).
The two source-internal multi-lemma nodes (thm:log der, thm:iwasawa 2) get
deeper trees; the one-paragraph source lemmas (lem:rest zp*, lem:closure) are
leaves.

### Feasibility assessment (Step 5)
§12 is FEASIBLE but is the project's largest single section, with two
critical-path sub-developments that are genuinely substantial:
(1) E12.1 (Galois action) — the linchpin; mathlib's `autEquivPow` +
`autToPow_spec` discharge the ABSTRACT iso, and Tower's `isCyclotomicExtension_K`
means it applies over ℚ_[p] directly; the NEW work is tower-compatibility +
levelNorm-commutation + assembling the action on NormCompatUnits and on power
series. No research-grade obstacle, but ~6–9 leaves of careful concrete work.
(2) E12.2 (thm:log der) — the hardest mathematics in Part II; lem:B mod p 2 is
an explicit 𝔽_p⟦T⟧ construction the authors flag as delicate; expect a Tier-A
spawn during execution. The §10 compactness + normOp infrastructure pays off
heavily here. Everything else (E12.3/E12.4/E12.5) is medium assembly on top.
NO leaf requires the deferred Λ-module structure theorem (that's §13). The
board stages E12.1 and E12.2 first as the gating clusters; the milestone
thm:iwasawa 2 is reachable once they land. PASS (staged), with the two flags
recorded for the execution session.
